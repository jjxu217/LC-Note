# 939. Minimum Area Rectangle

Given a set of points in the xy-plane, determine the minimum area of a rectangle formed from these points, with sides parallel to the x and y axes.

If there isn't any rectangle, return 0.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[2,2]]
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[4,1],[4,3]]
Output: 2
```

### Time = O\(n ^ 2\)

**Check diagonal:**   
For each pair of points, consider them to be the long diagonal of a potential rectangle   
e.g, if \(1, 1\) and \(5, 5\), check if we also have \(1, 5\) and \(5, 1\). If we do, we have a candidate rectangle.

```python
class Solution:
     def minAreaRect(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        S = set(map(tuple, points))
        ans = float('inf')
        for j, p2 in enumerate(points):
            for i in range(j):
                p1 = points[i]
                if (p1[0] != p2[0] and p1[1] != p2[1] and
                        (p1[0], p2[1]) in S and (p2[0], p1[1]) in S):
                    ans = min(ans, abs(p2[0] - p1[0]) * abs(p2[1] - p1[1]))
        return ans if ans < float('inf') else 0
```

**Sort by Column: O\(n^1.5\)  
Group the points by x coordinates**, so that we have columns of points. Then, for every pair of points in a column \(with coordinates \(x,y1\) and \(x,y2\)\), check for the smallest rectangle with this pair of points as the rightmost edge. We can do this by keeping memory of what pairs of points we've seen before.

```python
    def minAreaRect(self, points):
        columns = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for x, y in points:
            columns[x].append(y)
        lastx = {}
        ans = float('inf')

        for x in sorted(columns):
            column = columns[x]
            column.sort()
            for j, y2 in enumerate(column):
                for i in range(j):
                    y1 = column[i]
                    if (y1, y2) in lastx:
                        ans = min(ans, (x - lastx[y1,y2]) * (y2 - y1))
                    lastx[y1, y2] = x
        return ans if ans < float('inf') else 0
```
