# 973. K Closest Points to Origin

We have a list of `points` on the plane.  Find the `K` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

\(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.\)

You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique \(except for the order that it is in.\)

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation: 
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
(The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)
```

### Solution:

#### Note: 

sorted\(points,key=lambda x:x\[0\]2+x\[1\]2\) return the sorted list, however **points does not change.**

```python
def kClosest(self, points, K):
	return sorted(points,key=lambda x:x[0]**2+x[1]**2)[:K]
#Time = O(N.lgN)
```

```python
def kClosest(self, points, K):
	return heapq.nsmallest(K, points, lambda x: x[0]**2+x[1]**2)
#time = O(N.lgK)
```

```python
import heapq
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], K: int) -> List[List[int]]:       
        heap = []       
        for (x, y) in points:
            dist = -(x*x + y*y)
            if len(heap) == K:
                heapq.heappushpop(heap, (dist, x, y))
            else:
                heapq.heappush(heap, (dist, x, y))       
        return [(x,y) for (dist, x, y) in heap]
#time = O(N.lgK)
```
