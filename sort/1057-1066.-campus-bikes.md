# 1057/1066. Campus Bikes

On a campus represented as a 2D grid, there are `N` workers and `M` bikes, with `N <= M`. Each worker and bike is a 2D coordinate on this grid.

Our goal is to assign a bike to each worker. Among the available bikes and workers, we choose the \(worker, bike\) pair with the shortest Manhattan distance between each other, and assign the bike to that worker. \(If there are multiple \(worker, bike\) pairs with the same shortest Manhattan distance, we choose the pair with the smallest worker index; if there are multiple ways to do that, we choose the pair with the smallest bike index\). We repeat this process until there are no available workers.

The Manhattan distance between two points `p1` and `p2` is `Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|`.

Return a vector `ans` of length `N`, where `ans[i]` is the index \(0-indexed\) of the bike that the `i`-th worker is assigned to.

```text
Input: workers = [[0,0],[2,1]], bikes = [[1,2],[3,3]]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: 
Worker 1 grabs Bike 0 as they are closest (without ties), and Worker 0 is assigned Bike 1. So the output is [1, 0].
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/06/1261_example_2_v2.png)

```text
Input: workers = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0]], bikes = [[1,0],[2,2],[2,1]]
Output: [0,2,1]
Explanation: 
Worker 0 grabs Bike 0 at first. Worker 1 and Worker 2 share the same distance to Bike 2, thus Worker 1 is assigned to Bike 2, and Worker 2 will take Bike 1. So the output is [0,2,1].
```

```python
class Solution:
    def assignBikes(self, workers: List[List[int]], bikes: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        dist = lambda w,b: abs(w[0] - b[0]) + abs(w[1] - b[1])       
        n = len(workers)
        
        h = [(dist(w,b), i, j) for i, w in enumerate(workers) for j, b in enumerate(bikes)]
        h.sort()
        bset = set()
        res = [-1] * n
        cnt = 0
        for _, i, j in h:
            if res[i] == -1 and j not in bset:
                res[i] = j
                bset.add(j)
                cnt += 1                
            if cnt == n:
                break
        return res
```

## 1066. Campus Bikes II

On a campus represented as a 2D grid, there are `N` workers and `M` bikes, with `N <= M`. Each worker and bike is a 2D coordinate on this grid.

We assign one unique bike to each worker so that the sum of the Manhattan distances between each worker and their assigned bike is minimized.

The Manhattan distance between two points `p1` and `p2` is `Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|`.

Return the minimum possible sum of Manhattan distances between each worker and their assigned bike.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/06/1261_example_1_v2.png)

```text
Input: workers = [[0,0],[2,1]], bikes = [[1,2],[3,3]]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
We assign bike 0 to worker 0, bike 1 to worker 1. The Manhattan distance of both assignments is 3, so the output is 6.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/06/1261_example_2_v2.png)

```text
Input: workers = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0]], bikes = [[1,0],[2,2],[2,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
We first assign bike 0 to worker 0, then assign bike 1 to worker 1 or worker 2, bike 2 to worker 2 or worker 1. Both assignments lead to sum of the Manhattan distances as 4.
```

### Sol1: Dijkstra

Dijkstra on augmented graph: vertex \(states of chosen bikes, worker i\), edge: Manhattan distance.  
起始点\(dist=0, 0 worker, 0 state connection\); 终点\(dist, n workers, n state connections\);  
对于每个vertex（dist1, i worker, i state connections）, 它的相邻点是\(dist1 + cost to connect i+1 worker and some bike, i+1 worker, i+1 state connection\)

```python
    def assignBikes(self, workers, bikes):
        def dis(i, j):
            return abs(workers[i][0] - bikes[j][0]) + abs(workers[i][1] - bikes[j][1])
        h = [[0, 0, 0]]
        seen = set()
        while True:
            cost, i, taken = heapq.heappop(h) #expand node
            if i == len(workers): return cost #if achieve termination point
            if (i, taken) in seen: continue #如果当前node已经expand过了， continue
            #expand 当前node, generate neighbor node
            seen.add((i, taken))     
            for j in range(len(bikes)):
                if taken & (1 << j) == 0:
                    heapq.heappush(h, [cost + dis(i, j), i + 1, taken | (1 << j)])
```
