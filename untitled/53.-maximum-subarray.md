# 53/134/135/517 Greedy

## 53. Maximum Subarray

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray \(containing at least one number\) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example:**

```text
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

**Follow up:**

If you have figured out the O\(_n_\) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

### Idea: DP

1. Base case: dp\[0\] = nums\[0\]
2. Induction rule: dp\[i\] represents \[from 0-th element to the i-th element\] the largest sum of a subarray , **including the i-th element.**  Thus, if dp\[i -1\] &lt; 0, dp\[i\] = nums\[i\]; else dp\[i\] = nums\[i\] + dp\[i-1\]

Since dp\[i\] is only related with dp\[i-1\] we can use just one variable, which is just greedy. 

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = cur = nums[0]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if cur < 0:
                cur = nums[i]
            else: 
                cur += nums[i]
            res = max(res, cur)
        return res
```

## 134. Gas Station

There are _N_ gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station _i_ is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from station _i_ to its next station \(_i_+1\). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

**Note:**

* If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
* Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
* Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 
gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

Output: 3

Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: 
gas  = [2,3,4]
cost = [3,4,3]

Output: -1

Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
```

### Solution: Greedy: Proof by contradiction

```python
class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(gas)
        total_tank, cur_tank = 0, 0
        starting_station = 0
        for i in range(n):     
            total_tank += gas[i] - cost[i]
            cur_tank += gas[i] - cost[i]
            # If one couldn't get here,
            if cur_tank < 0:
                # Pick up the next station as the starting one.
                starting_station = i + 1
                # Start with an empty tank.
                cur_tank = 0
        return starting_station if total_tank >= 0 else -1
    #if total_tank >= 0, there is exactly one solution;
```

## 517. Super Washing Machines

You have **n** super washing machines on a line. Initially, each washing machine has some dresses or is empty.

For each **move**, you could choose **any m** \(1 ≤ m ≤ n\) washing machines, and pass **one dress** of each washing machine to one of its adjacent washing machines **at the same time** .

Given an integer array representing the number of dresses in each washing machine from left to right on the line, you should find the **minimum number of moves** to make all the washing machines have the same number of dresses. If it is not possible to do it, return -1.

**Example1**

```text
Input: [1,0,5]

Output: 3

Explanation: 
1st move:    1     0 <-- 5    =>    1     1     4
2nd move:    1 <-- 1 <-- 4    =>    2     1     3    
3rd move:    2     1 <-- 3    =>    2     2     2   
```

**Example2**

```text
Input: [0,3,0]

Output: 2

Explanation: 
1st move:    0 <-- 3     0    =>    1     2     0    
2nd move:    1     2 --> 0    =>    1     1     1     
```

**Example3**

```text
Input: [0,2,0]

Output: -1

Explanation: 
It's impossible to make all the three washing machines have the same number of dresses. 
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findMinMoves(self, machines: List[int]) -> int:
        #toRight means the clothes that we need to pass to the right number.
        total, n = sum(machines), len(machines)
        if total % n: return -1
        target, res, toRight = total // n, 0, 0
        for m in machines:
            toRight = toRight + m - target
            res = max(res, abs(toRight), m - target)
        return res
            
       
    def findMinMoves(self, machines: List[int]) -> int:
        total, n = sum(machines), len(machines)
        if total % n: return -1
        dress_per_machine = total // n
        for i in range(n):
            # Change the number of dresses in the machines to
            # the number of dresses to be removed from this machine
            # (could be negative)
            machines[i] -= dress_per_machine
            
        # curr_sum is a number of dresses to move at this point, 
        # max_sum is a max number of dresses to move at this point or before,
        # m is number of dresses to move out from the current machine.
        curr_sum = max_sum = res = 0
        for m in machines:
            curr_sum += m
            max_sum = max(max_sum, abs(curr_sum))
            res = max(res, max_sum, m)
        return res
```

## 135. Candy

There are _N_ children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

* Each child must have at least one candy.
* Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

What is the minimum candies you must give?

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
             The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

### SOL：two pass, left to right, right to left update array

```python
class Solution:
    #two pass
    #first consider only left side, if ratings larger than left side, candy += 1; then consider right side, update candies
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(ratings)
        candies = [1]*n
        #only consider left neigh, if ratings larger than left side, candy += 1
        for i in range(1, n): 
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]:
                candies[i] = candies[i-1] + 1
        #only consider right neigh, if ratings larger than left side, candy += 1 if needed
        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1): 
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i+1]:
                candies[i] = max(candies[i+1] + 1, candies[i])
        return sum(candies) #take the sum
```
