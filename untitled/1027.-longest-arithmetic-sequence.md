# 1027. Longest Arithmetic Sequence

Given an array `A` of integers, return the **length** of the longest arithmetic subsequence in `A`.

Recall that a _subsequence_ of `A` is a list `A[i_1], A[i_2], ..., A[i_k]` with `0 <= i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_k <= A.length - 1`, and that a sequence `B` is _arithmetic_ if `B[i+1] - B[i]` are all the same value \(for `0 <= i < B.length - 1`\).

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [3,6,9,12]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The whole array is an arithmetic sequence with steps of length = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [9,4,7,2,10]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The longest arithmetic subsequence is [4,7,10].
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: [20,1,15,3,10,5,8]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The longest arithmetic subsequence is [20,15,10,5].
```

### Sol: induction rule: dp\[idx, diff\] = dp.get\(\(j, diff\),1\) + 1 for j &lt; idx

Time = O\(n^2\)

```python
class Solution:
    def longestArithSeqLength(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = {}
        for i in range(1, len(A)):
            for j in range(i):
                dp[i, A[i] - A[j]] = dp.get((j, A[i] - A[j]), 1) + 1
        return max(dp.values())
```
