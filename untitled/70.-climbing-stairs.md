# 70/509/1137 Climbing Stairs/ Fibonacci Number/N-th Tribonacci Number

ou are climbing a stair case. It takes _n_ steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Note:** Given _n_ will be a positive integer.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

### Solution:

Based on the recursive formula:

> ```text
> f(1) = 1
> f(2) = 2
> f(k) = f(k-2) + f(k-1) 
> ```

-&gt;**just like fibonacci**

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        a = b = 1
        for _ in range(n):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return a
```

## 509. Fibonacci Number

The **Fibonacci numbers**, commonly denoted `F(n)` form a sequence, called the **Fibonacci sequence**, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from `0` and `1`. That is,

```text
F(0) = 0,   F(1) = 1
F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N > 1.
```

Given `N`, calculate `F(N)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def fib(self, N: int) -> int:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for _ in range(N):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return a
```

## 1137. N-th Tribonacci Number

The Tribonacci sequence Tn is defined as follows: 

T0 = 0, T1 = 1, T2 = 1, and Tn+3 = Tn + Tn+1 + Tn+2 for n &gt;= 0.

Given `n`, return the value of Tn.

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: n = 25
Output: 1389537
```

```python
class Solution:
    def tribonacci(self, n: int) -> int:
        l1, l2, l3 = 0, 1, 1
        for _ in range(n):
            l1, l2, l3 = l2, l3, l1 + l2 + l3
        return l1
```
