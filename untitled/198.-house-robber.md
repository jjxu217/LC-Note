# 198/213/337 House Robber

## 198. House Robber

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

### Solution:

Based on the recursive formula:

> ```text
> f(0) = nums[0]
> f(1) = max(num[0], num[1])
> f(k) = max( f(k-2) + nums[k], f(k-1) )
> ```

```python
class Solution: 
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return nums[0]
        p2, p1 = 0, nums[0]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            cur = max(p2 + nums[i], p1)
            p2, p1 = p1, cur
        return cur

#or just:
    def rob(self, nums):     
        pre, cur = 0, 0    
        for x in nums: 
            pre, cur = cur, max(pre + x, cur)                
        return cur
```

## 213. House Robber II

All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.**

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
             because they are adjacent houses.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

### Idea:

这道题相对于House Robber I里面要解决的edge就是circle的头和尾不能为邻居，那我们只需要在之前写好的代码基础上计算两个区间即可，第一个区间是nums\[1:\]， 第二个区间是nums\[:-1\]，在比较这两个区间哪个大即可。

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        
        def rob_linear(nums): 
            pre, cur = 0, 0    
            for x in nums: 
                pre, cur = cur, max(pre + x, cur)                
            return cur
        
        if not nums: return 0
        if len(nums) <= 2: return max(nums)
        return max(rob_linear(nums[1:]), rob_linear(nums[:-1]))
```

## **337.** House Robber III

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]

     3
    / \
   2   3
    \   \ 
     3   1

Output: 7 
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]

     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \   \ 
 1   3   1

Output: 9
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
```

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        
        def dfs(root):
        # 1st element is the maximum value include cur node, 2nd is exclude cur node
            if not root: return [0, 0] 
            l, r = dfs(root.left), dfs(root.right)
            return [root.val + l[1] + r[1], max(l) + max(r)]
        
        return max(dfs(root))
```
