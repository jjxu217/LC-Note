## 312. Burst Balloons

Given `n` balloons, indexed from `0` to `n-1`. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by array `nums`. You are asked to burst all the balloons. If the you burst balloon `i` you will get `nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right]` coins. Here `left` and `right` are adjacent indices of `i`. After the burst, the `left` and `right` then becomes adjacent.

Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

**Note:**

* You may imagine `nums[-1] = nums[n] = 1`. They are not real therefore you can not burst them.
* 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 500, 0 ≤ `nums[i]` ≤ 100

**Example:**

```text
Input: [3,1,5,8]
Output: 167 
Explanation: nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] -->   [3,8]   -->  [8]  --> []
             coins =  3*1*5      +  3*5*8    +  1*3*8      + 1*8*1   = 167
```

### Sol:

1. Divide and Conquer
   * After bursting balloon `i`, divide the problem into  `nums[0:i]` and `nums[i+1:]`.
   * Check every optimal solution after bursting each balloon.
   * **Since we will find the optimal solution for every range in nums, and we burst every balloon in every range to find the optimal solution, we have an O\(N^2\)∗O\(N\)=O\(N^3\) solution**
   * However, if we try to divide our problem in the order where we burst balloons first, we run into an issue. As balloons burst, the adjacency of other balloons changes. We are unable to keep track of what balloons the endpoints of our intervals are adjacent to. 
2. **Working Backwards**
   * **start with no balloons and add them in reverse order of how they were popped**. Each time we add a balloon, we can divide and conquer on its left and right sides, letting us add new balloons in between.
   * After add `i` ballon, divide the problem into left and right part. For the left part,  left boundary stays the same, right boundary is the element we just added. The opposite goes for the right interval. We compute the coins added from adding balloon `i` with `nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right]`.

**Base Case: `left + 1 == right:`no more balloons that can be added, dp\(left, right\) = 0  
Induction rule: `dp(left, right) = nums[left]*nums[i]*nums[right] + dp(left, i) + dp(i, right)`**

```python
class Solution:
    #start with no balloons and add them in reverse order of how they were popped
    #after add i-th ballon, divide the problem into left and right part. For the left part, left boundary stays the same, right boundary is the element we just added. The opposite goes for the right interval.
    
    #Top-down:
    def maxCoins(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums = [1] + nums + [1]
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        def calculate(left, right):
            if dp[left][right] or left + 1 == right: # base case: in memory or gap < 2
                return dp[left][right]         
            dp[left][right] =  max(nums[left]*nums[i]*nums[right] + calculate(left, i) + calculate(i, right) for i in range(left+1, right))
            return dp[left][right]
        
        return calculate(0, n-1)
    
    #bottom up
    def maxCoins(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:       
        nums = [1] + nums + [1] # build the complete array 
        n = len(nums)

        # dp will store the results of our calls
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

        # iterate over dp and incrementally build up to dp[0][n-1]
        for left in range(n-3, -1, -1):
            for right in range(left+2, n):
                # same formula to get the best score from (left, right) as before
                dp[left][right] = max(nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right] + dp[left][i] + dp[i][right] for i in range(left+1, right))
        return dp[0][n-1]
```

## 664. Strange Printer

There is a strange printer with the following two special requirements:

1. The printer can only print a sequence of the same character each time.
2. At each turn, the printer can print new characters starting from and ending at any places, and will cover the original existing characters.

Given a string consists of lower English letters only, your job is to count the minimum number of turns the printer needed in order to print it.

**Example 1:**  


```text
Input: "aaabbb"
Output: 2
Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "bbb".
```

**Example 2:**  


```text
Input: "aba"
Output: 2
Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "b" from the second place of the string, which will cover the existing character 'a'.
```

### Sol: dp\(i, j\) is the result for s\[i:j+1\]

To compute a recursion for dp\(i, j\), for every i &lt;= k &lt;= j with S\[i\] == S\[k\]  
k = i, the candidate is 1 + dp\(i+1, j\); other candidate answers dp\(i, k-1\) + dp\(k+1, j\), and we take the minimum of these candidates.

```python
class Solution:
    #dp(i, j) is the result for s[i:j+1]
    #To compute a recursion for dp(i, j), for every i <= k <= j with S[i] == S[k]
    #k = i, the candidate is 1 + dp(i+1, j); other candidate answers dp(i, k-1) + dp(k+1, j), and we take the minimum of these candidates.
    def strangePrinter(self, s: str) -> int:
        memo = {}
        s = ''.join(a for a, b in zip(s, '#' + s) if a != b) #Shorten the original string, like reduce aaabbb to ab
        
        def dp(i, j):
            if i > j: return 0
            if (i, j) not in memo:
                ans = dp(i + 1, j) + 1
                for k in range(i + 1, j + 1):
                    if s[k] == s[i]:
                        ans = min(ans, dp(i, k - 1) + dp(k + 1, j))
                memo[i, j] = ans
            return memo[i, j]
        
        return dp(0, len(s) - 1)
```
