# 664. Strange Printer

There is a strange printer with the following two special requirements:

1. The printer can only print a sequence of the same character each time.
2. At each turn, the printer can print new characters starting from and ending at any places, and will cover the original existing characters.

Given a string consists of lower English letters only, your job is to count the minimum number of turns the printer needed in order to print it.

**Example 1:**  


```text
Input: "aaabbb"
Output: 2
Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "bbb".
```

**Example 2:**  


```text
Input: "aba"
Output: 2
Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "b" from the second place of the string, which will cover the existing character 'a'.
```

### Sol: dp\(i, j\) is the result for s\[i:j+1\]

To compute a recursion for dp\(i, j\), for every i &lt;= k &lt;= j with S\[i\] == S\[k\]  
k = i, the candidate is 1 + dp\(i+1, j\); other candidate answers dp\(i, k-1\) + dp\(k+1, j\), and we take the minimum of these candidates.

```python
class Solution:
    #dp(i, j) is the result for s[i:j+1]
    #To compute a recursion for dp(i, j), for every i <= k <= j with S[i] == S[k]
    #k = i, the candidate is 1 + dp(i+1, j); other candidate answers dp(i, k-1) + dp(k+1, j), and we take the minimum of these candidates.
    def strangePrinter(self, s: str) -> int:
        memo = {}
        s = ''.join(a for a, b in zip(s, '#' + s) if a != b) #Shorten the original string, like reduce aaabbb to ab
        
        def dp(i, j):
            if i > j: return 0
            if (i, j) not in memo:
                ans = dp(i + 1, j) + 1
                for k in range(i + 1, j + 1):
                    if s[k] == s[i]:
                        ans = min(ans, dp(i, k - 1) + dp(k + 1, j))
                memo[i, j] = ans
            return memo[i, j]
        
        return dp(0, len(s) - 1)
```
