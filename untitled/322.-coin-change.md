# 322. Coin Change

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
Output: 3 
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
```

### Solution:

**Base case**: f\[0\] = 0  
**Induction Rule**:   
if i has solution: f\[i\] = min\(f\[i - c\] for c in coins if i &gt;= c\) + 1  
else:  f\[i\] = -1

```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        MAX = float('inf')
        dp = [0] + [MAX] * amount

        for i in range(1, amount + 1):
            dp[i] = min([dp[i - c] if i >= c else MAX for c in coins]) + 1
        
        return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != MAX else -1
```

If 找极值，用DP, 如果找出所有可能情况，要考虑DFS。
