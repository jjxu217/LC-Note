# 785. Is Graph Bipartite?

Given an undirected `graph`, return `true` if and only if it is bipartite.

Recall that a graph is _bipartite_ if we can split it's set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B.

The graph is given in the following form: `graph[i]` is a list of indexes `j` for which the edge between nodes `i` and `j` exists.  Each node is an integer between `0` and `graph.length - 1`.  There are no self edges or parallel edges: `graph[i]` does not contain `i`, and it doesn't contain any element twice.

Example 1:
Input: [[1,3], [0,2], [1,3], [0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:
0----1
|    |
|    |
3----2
We can divide the vertices into two groups: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
```

Example 2:
Input: [[1,2,3], [0,2], [0,1,3], [0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:
0----1
| \  |
|  \ |
3----2
We cannot find a way to divide the set of nodes into two independent subsets.
