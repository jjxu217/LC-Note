# 317. Shortest Distance from All Buildings

You want to build a house on an empty land which reaches all buildings in the shortest amount of distance. You can only move up, down, left and right. You are given a 2D grid of values **0**, **1** or **2**, where:

* Each **0** marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.
* Each **1** marks a building which you cannot pass through.
* Each **2** marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.

**Example:**

```text
Input: [[1,0,2,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]

1 - 0 - 2 - 0 - 1
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0

Output: 7 

Explanation: Given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2),
             the point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total 
             travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal. So return 7.
```

**Note:**  
There will be at least one building. If it is not possible to build such house according to the above rules, return -1.

### Sol: BFS

Start from all building, find the distance for all empty points.  
 Use _hit_ to record how many times a 0 grid has been reached and use _distSum_ to record the sum of distance from all 1 grids to this 0 grid. A powerful pruning is that during the BFS we use `cnt` to count how many `1` grids we reached. If `cnt < buildings` then we know not all `1` grids are connected are we can return `-1` immediately, which greatly improved speed.

**All position generate only once. When generate the node, add to `visited`,  record distance. Expand node just to generate neighbor.   
`Hit` is must in use, see in \[\[1,1\],\[0,1\]\] case**

```python
class Solution:      
    def shortestDistance(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:    
        if not grid or not grid[0]: return -1
        M, N, buildings = len(grid), len(grid[0]), sum(1 for line in grid for val in line if val == 1)
        hit, distSum = [[0]*N for _ in range(M)], [[0]*N for _ in range(M)]

        def BFS(start_x, start_y):
            visited = [[False]*N for _ in range(M)]
            visited[start_x][start_y], cnt, queue = True, 1, collections.deque([(start_x, start_y, 0)])
            while queue:
                x, y, dist = queue.popleft()
                for i, j in [(x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), (x, y-1)]:
                    if 0 <= i < M and 0 <= j < N and not visited[i][j]:
                        visited[i][j] = True #
                        if not grid[i][j]:
                            queue.append((i, j, dist+1))
                            hit[i][j] += 1
                            distSum[i][j] += dist + 1
                        elif grid[i][j] == 1:
                            cnt += 1
            return cnt == buildings

        for i in range(M):
            for j in range(N):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    if not BFS(i, j):
                        return -1
        return min([distSum[i][j] for i in range(M) for j in range(N) if grid[i][j] == 0 and hit[i][j] == buildings] or [-1])
```
