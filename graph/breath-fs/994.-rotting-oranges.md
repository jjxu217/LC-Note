# 994. Rotting Oranges

In a given grid, each cell can have one of three values:

* the value `0` representing an empty cell;
* the value `1` representing a fresh orange;
* the value `2` representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is adjacent \(4-directionally\) to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange.  If this is impossible, return `-1` instead.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/16/oranges.png)

```text
Input: [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation:  The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation:  Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
```

```python
class Solution:
    #BFS
    def orangesRotting(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        # queue - cells with rotting oranges (row, col, depth), initialized
        queue = collections.deque([(r,c,0) for r, row in enumerate(grid) for c, val in enumerate(row) if val == 2])
        
        d = 0
        while queue:
            r, c, d = queue.popleft()
            for R, C in ((r+1,c),(r-1,c),(r,c+1),(r,c-1)):
                if 0 <= R < m and 0 <= C < n and grid[R][C] == 1:
                    grid[R][C] = 2
                    queue.append((R, C, d+1))
        
        return d if all(1 not in row for row in grid) else -1
```
