# 286. Walls and Gates

You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.

1. `-1` - A wall or an obstacle.
2. `0` - A gate.
3. `INF` - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value `231 - 1 = 2147483647` to represent `INF` as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than `2147483647`.

Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with `INF`.

**Example:** 

Given the 2D grid:

```text
INF  -1  0  INF
INF INF INF  -1
INF  -1 INF  -1
  0  -1 INF INF
```

After running your function, the 2D grid should be:

```text
  3  -1   0   1
  2   2   1  -1
  1  -1   2  -1
  0  -1   3   
```

```python
class Solution:
    #BFS
    def wallsAndGates(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        #find all gate
        q = [(i, j) for i, row in enumerate(rooms) for j, r in enumerate(row) if not r] 
        for i, j in q:
            for I, J in (i+1, j), (i-1, j), (i, j+1), (i, j-1):
            #if feasible and rooms[I][J]=INF
                if 0 <= I < len(rooms) and 0 <= J < len(rooms[0]) and rooms[I][J] > 2**30:                     
                    rooms[I][J] = rooms[i][j] + 1
                    q.append((I, J))
                
    #DFS
    def wallsAndGates(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        if not rooms or not rooms[0]:
            return
        m, n = len(rooms), len(rooms[0])
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if rooms[i][j] == 0:
                    self.traverse(rooms, i, j, m, n)
    
    def traverse(self, room, i, j, m, n):
        for I, J in ((i + 1, j), (i - 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i, j -1)) :
        #if feasible and find closer disance, update
            if 0 <= I < m and 0 <= J < n  and  room[I][J] > room[i][j] + 1: 
                room[I][J] = room[i][j] + 1
                self.traverse(room, I, J, m, n)
```
