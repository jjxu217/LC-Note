# 269/953 Verifying an Alien Dictionary

## 269. Alien Dictionary

There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters are unknown to you. You receive a list of **non-empty** words from the dictionary, where **words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language**. Derive the order of letters in this language.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:
[
  "wrt",
  "wrf",
  "er",
  "ett",
  "rftt"
]

Output: "wertf"
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input:
[
  "z",
  "x"
]

Output: "zx"
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input:
[
  "z",
  "x",
  "z"
] 

Output: "" 

Explanation: The order is invalid, so return "".
```

```python
class Solution:
    def alienOrder(self, words: List[str]) -> str:
        pre, sub = collections.defaultdict(set), collections.defaultdict(set)
        for pair in zip(words, words[1:]):
            for a, b in zip(*pair):
                if a != b: #add then break
                    sub[a].add(b)
                    pre[b].add(a)
                    break 
        chars = set(''.join(words)) #all possible chars
        free = chars - set(pre) #free chars
        order = ''
        while free:
            a = free.pop()
            order += a
            for b in sub[a]:
                pre[b].remove(a)
                if not pre[b]:
                    free.add(b)
        return order if set(order) == chars else ''
```

## 953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary

In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but possibly in a different `order`. The `order` of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of `words` written in the alien language, and the `order` of the alphabet, return `true` if and only if the given `words` are sorted lexicographicaly in this alien language.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character (More info).
```

```python
class Solution:
    def isAlienSorted(self, words: List[str], order: str) -> bool:
        ind = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(order)}
        for a, b in zip(words, words[1:]):
            if len(a) > len(b) and a[:len(b)] == b: #match part, compare length
                return False
            for s1, s2 in zip(a, b):
                if ind[s1] < ind[s2]: #satisfied
                    break
                elif ind[s1] > ind[s2]: 
                    return False
        return True
        
        
    def isAlienSorted(self, words, order):
        m = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(order)}
        words = [[m[c] for c in w] for w in words]
        return all(w1 <= w2 for w1, w2 in zip(words, words[1:]))
```
