# 518. Coin Change 2

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
Output: 1
```

### Solution1: DP

#### **Knapsack problem 2D-DP**

`dp[i][j]` : the number of combinations to make up amount `j` by using the first `i` types of coins  
`State transition`:

1. not using the `i`th coin, only using the first `i-1` coins to make up amount `j`, then we have `dp[i-1][j]` ways. ****`dp[i - 1][j]`: 完全不用当前硬币组成j有多少种组合
2. using the `i`th coin, since we can use unlimited same coin, we need to know how many ways to make up amount `j - coins[i]` by using first `i` coins\(including `i`th\), which is `dp[i][j-coins[i](`使用**至少一个**当前硬币（与上面一条是互斥事件）组成组成j有多少组合\)

`Initialization`: `dp[i][0] = 1`

Now we can see that `dp[i][j]` only rely on `dp[i-1][j]` and `dp[i][j-coins[i]]`, then we can optimize the space by only using one-dimension array.

#### Base case & induction rule: 

* dp\[0\] = 1  \#one method for 0 amount
* dp\[j\] = d\[j\] +  dp\[j - i\]    \#number of method for amount j  = number of method without current coin i + number of method with current coin

```python
def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:        
    dp = [1] + [0] * amount 
    for i in coins:
        for j in range(i, amount + 1):
              dp[j] += dp[j - i]
    return dp[amount]
```

```python
#Recursion (TLE)
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        self.cnt = 0
        self.dfs(0, amount, coins)
        return self.cnt
    
    def dfs(self, idx, remain, coins):
        if idx == len(coins):
            if remain == 0:
                self.cnt += 1
            return
        for i in range(remain // coins[idx] + 1):
            self.dfs(idx + 1, remain - i * coins[idx], coins)
```
