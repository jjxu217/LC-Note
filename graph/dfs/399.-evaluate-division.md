# 399. Evaluate Division

Equations are given in the format `A / B = k`, where `A` and `B` are variables represented as strings, and `k` is a real number \(floating point number\). Given some queries, return the answers. If the answer does not exist, return `-1.0`.

**Example:**  
Given `a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0.`  
queries are: `a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ? .`  
return `[6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ].`

The input is: `vector<pair<string, string>> equations, vector<double>& values, vector<pair<string, string>> queries` , where `equations.size() == values.size()`, and the values are positive. This represents the equations. Return `vector<double>`.

According to the example above:

```text
equations = [ ["a", "b"], ["b", "c"] ],
values = [2.0, 3.0],
queries = [ ["a", "c"], ["b", "a"], ["a", "e"], ["a", "a"], ["x", "x"] ]. 
```

### Sol

A series of equations `A / B = k` can be seen as a graph in which nodes are the dividend and divisor A and B and weights are the result of the division. So we simply create the graph and traverse it with DFS/BFS to get our result.

Complexity is `K * O(N + M)` where N and M are the number of nodes and edges, and `K` is the number of queries. How many nodes can we have? It's `2 * E`, where `E` is the number of equations \(2 different nodes per each equation\). We can have at most `E` edges in the graph.

So total complexity is `O(K * E)`, with `O(E)` additional space for the graph.

    ## BFS

        for (f, t), value in zip(equations, values):
            graph[f].append((t, value))
            graph[t].append((f, 1/value))

        def find_path(b, e):      
            if b not in graph or e not in graph:
                return -1.0               
            q = collections.deque([(b, 1.0)])
            visited = set()

            return -1.0
        
        return [find_path(X, Y) for X, Y in queries]
