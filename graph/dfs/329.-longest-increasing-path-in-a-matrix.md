# 329. Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix

Given an integer matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path.

From each cell, you can either move to four directions: left, right, up or down. You may NOT move diagonally or move outside of the boundary \(i.e. wrap-around is not allowed\).

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = 
[
  [9,9,4],
  [6,6,8],
  [2,1,1]
] 
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = 
[
  [3,4,5],
  [3,2,6],
  [2,2,1]
] 
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally is not allowed.
```

### Sol: DFS with memo

```python
class Solution:
    def longestIncreasingPath(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        #dfs with memo
        def dfs(i, j):
            if not dp[i][j]:
                pre = 0
                for (I, J) in ((i+1,j),(i-1, j),(i,j+1),(i, j-1)):
                    if 0 <= I < M and 0 <= J < N and matrix[i][j] > matrix[I][J]:
                        pre = max(pre, dfs(I, J))
                    dp[i][j] = pre + 1
            return dp[i][j]
        
        if not matrix or not matrix[0]: return 0
        M, N = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        dp = [[0] * N for _ in range(M)]
        return max(dfs(i, j) for i in range(M) for j in range(N))
```
