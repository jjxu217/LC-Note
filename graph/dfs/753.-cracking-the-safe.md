# 753. Cracking the Safe

There is a box protected by a password. The password is a sequence of `n` digits where each digit can be one of the first `k` digits `0, 1, ..., k-1`.

While entering a password, the last `n` digits entered will automatically be matched against the correct password.

For example, assuming the correct password is `"345"`, if you type `"012345"`, the box will open because the correct password matches the suffix of the entered password.

Return any password of **minimum length** that is guaranteed to open the box at some point of entering it.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: n = 1, k = 2
Output: "01"
Note: "10" will be accepted too.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: n = 2, k = 2
Output: "00110"
Note: "01100", "10011", "11001" will be accepted too.
```

### Back-tracking

```python
class Solution:
    #time = O(k * k^n)
    def crackSafe(self, n: int, k: int) -> str:
        def dfs(curr, visits):
            if len(visits) == k**n:
                return curr           
            for i in range(k):
                nxt = curr[-(n-1):]+str(i) if n!=1 else str(i)
                if nxt not in visits:
                    visits.add(nxt)
                    res = dfs(curr+str(i), visits)
                    if res: return res        
                    visits.remove(nxt)
                    
        return dfs("0"*n, set(["0"*n]))
```
