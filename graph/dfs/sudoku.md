# Sudoku

## 37. Sudoku Solver

Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A sudoku solution must satisfy **all of the following rules**:

1. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each row.
2. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each column.
3. Each of the the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid.

Empty cells are indicated by the character `'.'`.

...and its solution numbers marked in red.

```python
class Solution:
    def solveSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:       
        pos = [(i, j) for i in range(9) for j in range(9) if board[i][j] == "."]
        
        def dfs():
            if not pos: return True
            x, y = pos.pop()
            box = set(board[x//3*3+i][y//3*3+j] for i in range(3) for j in range(3))
            row = set(board[x][j] for j in range(9))
            col = set(board[i][y] for i in range(9))    
            for i in '123456789':
                if i not in box and i not in row and i not in col:
                    board[x][y] = i
                    if dfs(): return True
            board[x][y] = '.'
            pos.append((x,y))
            return False
        
        dfs()                  
```

## 36. Valid Sudoku

Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules**:

1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

A partially filled sudoku which is valid.

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character `'.'`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:
[
  ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input:
[
  ["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being 
    modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
```

```python
class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        seen = []
        for i, row in enumerate(board):
            for j, c in enumerate(row):
                if c != '.':
                    seen += [('c', j, c), ('r', i, c), (i//3,j//3,c)]
        return len(seen) == len(set(seen))
```
