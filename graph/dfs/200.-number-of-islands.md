## 200. Number of Islands

Given a 2d grid map of `'1'`s \(land\) and `'0'`s \(water\), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:
11110
11010
11000
00000

Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input:
11000
11000
00100
00011

Output: 3
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        cnt = 0
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] == '1':
                    cnt += 1
                    self.dfs(grid, i, j)
        return cnt
    
    #run dfs, sink one island
    def dfs(self, grid, i, j):
        grid[i][j] = '#'
        for a, b in [(i + 1, j), (i - 1, j), (i, j  + 1), (i, j  - 1)]:
            if 0 <= a < len(grid) and 0 <= b < len(grid[0]) and grid[a][b] == '1':
                self.dfs(grid, a, b)
```

## 419. Battleships in a Board

Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with `'X'`s, empty slots are represented with `'.'`s. You may assume the following rules:

* You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.
* Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape `1xN` \(1 row, N columns\) or `Nx1` \(N rows, 1 column\), where N can be of any size.
* At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships.

**Example:**  


```text
X..X
...X
...X
```

In the above board there are 2 battleships.

**Invalid Example:**  


```text
...X
XXXX
...X
```

This is an invalid board that you will not receive - as battleships will always have a cell separating between them.

**Follow up:**  
Could you do it in **one-pass**, using only **O\(1\) extra memory** and **without modifying** the value of the board?

```python
class Solution:
    def countBattleships(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(board)):
            for j in range(len(board[0])):
                if board[i][j] == 'X':
                    flag = 1
                    if j > 0 and board[i][j-1] == 'X': flag = 0
                    if i > 0 and board[i-1][j] == 'X': flag = 0
                    res += flag
        return res  
```

## 694. Number of Distinct Islands

Given a non-empty 2D array `grid` of 0's and 1's, an **island** is a group of `1`'s \(representing land\) connected 4-directionally \(horizontal or vertical.\) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Count the number of **distinct** islands. An island is considered to be the same as another if and only if one island can be translated \(and not rotated or reflected\) to equal the other.

**Example 1:**  


```text
11000
11000
00011
00011
```

Given the above grid map, return `1`.

**Example 2:**  


```text
11011
10000
00001
11011
```

Given the above grid map, return `3`.

```python
class Solution:
    def numDistinctIslands(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        
        def dfs(r, c, r0, c0): #cur r/c and starting r/c 
            #deal with cur pos
            grid[r][c] = 0
            shape.add((r-r0, c-c0))
            #deal with nei
            for i, j in ((r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1)):
                if 0 <= i < m and 0 <= j < n and grid[i][j]:
                    dfs(i, j, r0, c0)
                     
        shapes = set()
        for r in range(m):
            for c in range(n):
                if grid[r][c] == 1:
                    shape = set() #record the relative pos
                    dfs(r, c, r, c)
                    shapes.add(frozenset(shape))
        return len(shapes)
```

## 711. Number of Distinct Islands II

Given a non-empty 2D array `grid` of 0's and 1's, an **island** is a group of `1`'s \(representing land\) connected 4-directionally \(horizontal or vertical.\) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Count the number of **distinct** islands. An island is considered to be the same as another if they have the same shape, or have the same shape after **rotation** \(90, 180, or 270 degrees only\) or **reflection** \(left/right direction or up/down direction\).

**Example 1:**  


```text
11000
10000
00001
00011
```

Given the above grid map, return `1`.  
  
Notice that:

```text
11
1
```

and

```text
 1
11
```

are considered **same** island shapes. Because if we make a 180 degrees clockwise rotation on the first island, then two islands will have the same shapes.

**Example 2:**  


```text
11100
10001
01001
01110
```

Given the above grid map, return `2`.  
  
Here are the two distinct islands:

```text
111
1
```

and

```text
1
1
```

  
Notice that:

```text
111
1
```

and

```text
1
111
```

are considered **same** island shapes. Because if we flip the first array in the up/down direction, then they have the same shapes.

### **Sol: Canonical Hash** 

We feature two different implementations, but the core idea is the same. We start with the code from the previous problem, _Number of Distinct Islands_.

For each of 8 possible rotations and reflections of the shape, we will perform the transformation and then translate the shape so that the bottom-left-most coordinate is \(0, 0\). Afterwards, we will consider the canonical hash of the shape to be the maximum of these 8 intermediate hashes.

In Python, the motivation to use complex numbers is that rotation by 90 degrees is the same as multiplying by the imaginary unit, `1j`. The 8 rotations and reflections of each point are `(x, y), (-x, y), (x, -y), (-x, -y), (y, x), (-y, x), (y, -x), (-y, -x)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def numDistinctIslands2(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:    
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        
        def dfs(r, c, r0, c0): #cur r/c and starting r/c 
            #deal with cur pos
            grid[r][c] = 0
            shape.add(complex(r-r0, c-c0))
            #deal with nei
            for i, j in ((r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1)):
                if 0 <= i < m and 0 <= j < n and grid[i][j]:
                    dfs(i, j, r0, c0)
                     
        def canonical(shape):
            def translate(shape):
                w = complex(min(z.real for z in shape),
                            min(z.imag for z in shape))
                return sorted(str(z-w) for z in shape)    
            #8种变体
            shape_variaty = []
            for k in range(4):
                shape_variaty.append(translate([z * (1j)**k for z in shape]))
                shape_variaty.append(translate([complex(z.imag, z.real) * (1j)**k for z in shape]))
            return frozenset(min(shape_variaty))
        
        shapes = set()
        for r in range(m):
            for c in range(n):
                if grid[r][c] == 1:
                    shape = set() #record the relative pos
                    dfs(r, c, r, c)
                    shapes.add(canonical(shape))
        return len(shapes)
```

## 659. Max Area of Island

Given a non-empty 2D array `grid` of 0's and 1's, an **island** is a group of `1`'s \(representing land\) connected 4-directionally \(horizontal or vertical.\) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. \(If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.\)

**Example 1:**

```text
[[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
```

Given the above grid, return `6`. Note the answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

**Example 2:**

```text
[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
```

Given the above grid, return `0`.

**Note:** The length of each dimension in the given `grid` does not exceed 50.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        seen = set()
        
        def area(r, c):
            if 0 <= r < len(grid) and 0 <= c < len(grid[0]) \
                and (r, c) not in seen and grid[r][c]:
                seen.add((r, c))
                return (1 + area(r+1, c) + area(r-1, c) + area(r, c-1) + area(r, c+1))
            return 0
        
        return max(area(r, c) for r in range(len(grid)) 
                   for c in range(len(grid[0])))
```
