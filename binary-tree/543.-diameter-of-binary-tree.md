# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

## 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the **longest** path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

**Example:**  
Given a binary tree  


```text
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
```

Return **3**, which is the length of the path \[4,2,1,3\] or \[5,2,1,3\].

**Note:** The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

```python
class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root: return 0
        self.res = 0 #res represent the number of node of the longest path
        self.helper(root)
        return self.res - 1 # diameter is number of node -1
        
    def helper(self, root):
        if not root: return 0
        l, r = self.helper(root.left), self.helper(root.right)
        self.res = max(self.res, l + r + 1)
        return 1 + max(l, r)
```
