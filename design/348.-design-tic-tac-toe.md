# 348. Design Tic-Tac-Toe

Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid.

You may assume the following rules:

1. A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
2. Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
3. A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

**Example:**

```text
Given n = 3, assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.

TicTacToe toe = new TicTacToe(3);

toe.move(0, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| | |
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
| | | |

toe.move(0, 2, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
| | | |

toe.move(2, 2, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
| | |X|

toe.move(1, 1, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
| | |X|

toe.move(2, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(1, 0, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(2, 1, 1); -> Returns 1 (player 1 wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
|X|X|X|
```

### sol: set player value to +/-1, record the total value for each row/col/diag/anti\_diag

```python
class TicTacToe:
    def __init__(self, n: int):
        self.row, self.col, self.diag, self.anti_diag, self.n = [0]*n, [0]*n, 0, 0, n

    def move(self, row: int, col: int, player: int) -> int:
        """
        Player {player} makes a move at ({row}, {col}).
        @param row The row of the board.
        @param col The column of the board.
        @param player The player, can be either 1 or 2.
        @return The current winning condition, can be either:
                0: No one wins.
                1: Player 1 wins.
                2: Player 2 wins.
        """
        player_val = 2 * player - 3 #make the value to +/-1
        self.row[row] += player_val
        self.col[col] += player_val
        if row == col:
            self.diag += player_val
        if row + col == self.n - 1:
            self.anti_diag += player_val
        #find if any player win
        if player_val * self.n in [self.row[row], self.col[col], self.diag, self.anti_diag]:
            return player
        return 0
