# 348. Design Tic-Tac-Toe

Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid.

You may assume the following rules:

1. A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
2. Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
3. A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

**Example:**

```text
Given n = 3, assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.

TicTacToe toe = new TicTacToe(3);

toe.move(0, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| | |
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
| | | |

toe.move(0, 2, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
| | | |

toe.move(2, 2, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
| | |X|

toe.move(1, 1, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
| | |X|

toe.move(2, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(1, 0, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(2, 1, 1); -> Returns 1 (player 1 wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
|X|X|X|
```

### sol: set player value to +/-1, record the total value for each row/col/diag/anti\_diag

```python
class TicTacToe:
    def __init__(self, n: int):
        self.row, self.col, self.diag, self.anti_diag, self.n = [0]*n, [0]*n, 0, 0, n

    def move(self, row: int, col: int, player: int) -> int:
        """
        Player {player} makes a move at ({row}, {col}).
        @param row The row of the board.
        @param col The column of the board.
        @param player The player, can be either 1 or 2.
        @return The current winning condition, can be either:
                0: No one wins.
                1: Player 1 wins.
                2: Player 2 wins.
        """
        player_val = 1 if player == 2 else -1 #make the value to +/-1
        self.row[row] += player_val
        self.col[col] += player_val
        if row == col:
            self.diag += player_val
        if row + col == self.n - 1:
            self.anti_diag += player_val
        #find if any player win
        if player_val * self.n in [self.row[row], self.col[col], self.diag, self.anti_diag]:
            return player
        return 0
```

## 794. Valid Tic-Tac-Toe State

A Tic-Tac-Toe board is given as a string array `board`. Return True if and only if it is possible to reach this board position during the course of a valid tic-tac-toe game.

The `board` is a 3 x 3 array, and consists of characters `" "`, `"X"`, and `"O"`.  The " " character represents an empty square.

Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

* Players take turns placing characters into empty squares \(" "\).
* The first player always places "X" characters, while the second player always places "O" characters.
* "X" and "O" characters are always placed into empty squares, never filled ones.
* The game ends when there are 3 of the same \(non-empty\) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
* The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
* No more moves can be played if the game is over.

```text
Example 1:
Input: board = ["O  ", "   ", "   "]
Output: false
Explanation: The first player always plays "X".

Example 2:
Input: board = ["XOX", " X ", "   "]
Output: false
Explanation: Players take turns making moves.

Example 3:
Input: board = ["XXX", "   ", "OOO"]
Output: false

Example 4:
Input: board = ["XOX", "O O", "XOX"]
Output: true
```

To find the validity of a given board, we could first think about the cases where the board is invalid

1. Since X starts first, x\_count &gt;= o\_count. So if o\_count &gt; x\_count, we can return False
2. Since the players take turns, we could also return False if x\_count-o\_count&gt;1

After the corner cases, this is the algorithm used:

1. If player O has a winning condition, also check the following: a\) If player X also has a winning condition, return False b\) If x\_count != o\_count , return False \(Since player O always plays second, it has to meet this condition always\)
2. If player X has a winning condition, check the following: a\) If x\_count != o\_count + 1, return False \(Since player X plays the first move, if player X wins, the player X's count would be 1 more than player O\)

```python
class Solution(object):
    def check_win_positions(self, board, player):
        #Check the rows
        for i in range(len(board)):
            if board[i][0] == board[i][1] == board[i][2] == player:
                return True                        

        #Check the columns
        for i in range(len(board)):
            if board[0][i] == board[1][i] == board[2][i] == player:
                return True 
										
        #Check the diagonals
        if board[0][0] == board[1][1] == board[2][2]  == player or \
               board[0][2] == board[1][1] == board[2][0] == player:
            return True
						
        return False
        
    def validTicTacToe(self, board):   
        x_count, o_count = 0, 0
        for i in range(len(board)):
            for j in range(len(board[0])):
                if board[i][j] == "X":
                    x_count += 1
                elif  board[i][j] == "O":
                    o_count += 1
										
        if o_count > x_count or x_count-o_count>1:
            return False
        
        if self.check_win_positions(board, 'O'):
            if self.check_win_positions(board, 'X'):
                return False
            return o_count == x_count
        
        if self.check_win_positions(board, 'X') and x_count!=o_count+1:
            return False

        return True
```
