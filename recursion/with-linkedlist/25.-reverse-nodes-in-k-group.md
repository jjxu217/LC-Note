# 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list _k_ at a time and return its modified list.

_k_ is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of _k_ then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

**Example:**

Given this linked list: `1->2->3->4->5`

For _k_ = 2, you should return: `2->1->4->3->5`

For _k_ = 3, you should return: `3->2->1->4->5`

**Note:**

* Only constant extra memory is allowed.
* You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

### Solution:

**pre=head** initialization is important in the iteration method, but not necessary in recursion. Since in iteration, this connect the left-out nodes. However, in recursion, the left-out nodes will be connected again by return the head of left-out nodes and **orig.next = new\_head**. 

```python
class Solution:
    #recursion
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:  
        orig = head
        i = 0
        while head and i < k:
            head = head.next
            i += 1
        #head is the k-th node or the node before k-th
        #base case: if head is None, just return the original node
        if i < k:
            return orig
        
        #recursive rule
        new_head = self.reverseKGroup(head, k)
        #reverse within k node
        pre, cur = head, orig #head can be None
        while cur != head:
            cur.next, pre, cur = pre, cur, cur.next
        #connect k-group
        orig.next = new_head
        return pre
        
    #iteration
    def reverseKGroup(self, head, k):
        dummy = jump = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = orig = head

        while True:
            i = 0
            while head and i < k:   # use r to locate the range
                head = head.next
                i += 1
            if i < k:
                return dummy.next
            # if size k satisfied, reverse the inner linked list
            pre, cur = head, orig #<-this pre=head initialization is important
            for _ in range(k):
                cur.next, cur, pre = pre, cur.next, cur  # standard reversing
            jump.next, jump, orig = pre, orig, head  # connect two k-groups
       
```
