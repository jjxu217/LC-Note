# 501. Find Mode in Binary Search Tree

Given a binary search tree \(BST\) with duplicates, find all the [mode\(s\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_%28statistics%29) \(the most frequently occurred element\) in the given BST.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than or equal to** the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than or equal to** the node's key.
* Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

For example:  
Given BST `[1,null,2,2]`,

```text
   1
    \
     2
    /
   2
```

return `[2]`.

**Note:** If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.

**Follow up:** Could you do that without using any extra space? \(Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count\).

### Solution

**O\(N\) time & O\(N\) Space**

* Use a dictionary to store the frequency of each integer. Then simply find the largest frequency and return all the associated keys.
* Note we do not use the property of BST in this solution.

```python
class Solution:
    def findMode(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
        c = collections.Counter()
        
        def helper(root):
            if not root:
                return
            c[root.val] += 1
            helper(root.left)
            helper(root.right)
            
        helper(root)
        return [i for i in c if c[i] == c.most_common(1)[0][1]]
```

**O\(N\) time and O\(1\) Space**

* Write BST Iterator class which gives the next element in\_order. Now the problem reduces to finding mode in a sorted array.
* Instead of a BST iterator, we can use a recursive inorder traversal and store a class variable pre to indicate the previous integer.
