# 1123. Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves

## 1123. [Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-deepest-leaves/)

Given a rooted binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.

Recall that:

* The node of a binary tree is a _leaf_ if and only if it has no children
* The _depth_ of the root of the tree is 0, and if the depth of a node is `d`, the depth of each of its children is `d+1`.
* The _lowest common ancestor_ of a set `S` of nodes is the node `A` with the largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with root `A`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation: 
The deepest leaves are the nodes with values 2 and 3.
The lowest common ancestor of these leaves is the node with value 1.
The answer returned is a TreeNode object (not an array) with serialization "[1,2,3]".
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [4]
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [2,4,5]
```

```python
#sub-tree return two things: (sub-tree res, sub-tree depth)
    def lcaDeepestLeaves(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        def helper(root):
            if not root: return root, 0
            l, r = helper(root.left), helper(root.right)
            if l[1] > r[1]:
                return (l[0], l[1] + 1)
            elif l[1] < r[1]:
                return (r[0], r[1] + 1)
            else:
                return (root, l[1] + 1)
            
        return helper(root)[0]
```

## 865. Smallest Subtree with all the Deepest Nodes

Given a binary tree rooted at `root`, the _depth_ of each node is the shortest distance to the root.

A node is _deepest_ if it has the largest depth possible among any node in the entire tree.

The subtree of a node is that node, plus the set of all descendants of that node.

Return the node with the largest depth such that it contains all the deepest nodes in its subtree.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
Output: [2,7,4]
Explanation:
We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.
The nodes colored in blue are the deepest nodes of the tree.
The input "[3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 0, 8, null, null, 7, 4]" is a serialization of the given tree.
The output "[2, 7, 4]" is a serialization of the subtree rooted at the node with value 2.
Both the input and output have TreeNode type.

### Sol: A sub function deep\(TreeNode root\), Return a pair\(int depth, TreeNode subtreeWithAllDeepest\) 

if `root == None`, return pair\(0, None\)   
l, r = deep\(root.left\), deep\(root.right\)   
if `l.depth == r.depth`, deepest nodes both in the left and right subtree, return pair \(l.depth + 1, root\)   
elif `l.depth > r.depth`, deepest nodes only in the left subtree, return pair \(l.depth, left node\)   
elif `l.depth < r.depth`, deepest nodes only in the right subtree, return pair \(r.depth, right node\)

```python
class Solution:
    #a sub function deep(TreeNode root), Return a pair(int depth, TreeNode subtreeWithAllDeepest)
    #if root == None, return pair(0, None)
    #l, r = deep(root.left), deep(root.right)
    #if l.depth == r.depth, deepest nodes both in the left and right subtree, return pair (l.depth + 1, root)
    #elif l.depth > r.depth, deepest nodes only in the left subtree, return pair (l.depth, left node)
    #elif l.depth < r.depth, deepest nodes only in the right subtree, return pair (r.depth, right node)
    
    def subtreeWithAllDeepest(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        def deep(root):
            if not root: return 0, None
            l, r = deep(root.left), deep(root.right)
            if l[0] == r[0]: 
                return l[0] + 1, root
            elif l[0] > r[0]: 
                return l[0] + 1, l[1]
            else l[0] < r[0]: 
                return r[0] + 1, r[1]         
        return deep(root)[1]
```
