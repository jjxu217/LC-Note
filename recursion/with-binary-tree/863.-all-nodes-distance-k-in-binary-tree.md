# 863. All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree

We are given a binary tree \(with root node `root`\), a `target` node, and an integer value `K`.

Return a list of the values of all nodes that have a distance `K` from the `target` node.  The answer can be returned in any order.

1. 
**Example 1:**

```text
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, K = 2

Output: [7,4,1]

Explanation: 
The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5)
have values 7, 4, and 1.

Note that the inputs "root" and "target" are actually TreeNodes.
The descriptions of the inputs above are just serializations of these objects.

**Note:**

1. The given tree is non-empty.
2. Each node in the tree has unique values `0 <= node.val <= 500`.
3. The `target` node is a node in the tree.
4. `0 <= K <= 1000`.

### DFS to annotate parent. See target as the root for the new tree, do BFS to find res.

```python
class Solution:
    def distanceK(self, root, target, K):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type target: TreeNode
        :type K: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        #DFS to annotate Parent
        def dfs(node, par = None):
            if node:
                node.par = par
                dfs(node.left, node)
                dfs(node.right, node)
        dfs(root)

        #BFS
        level = [target]
        seen = {target, None}
        for i in range(K):
            level = [nxt for node in level for nxt in (node.left, node.right, node.par) if nxt not in seen]
            seen |= set(level)
        return [node.val for node in level]
```
