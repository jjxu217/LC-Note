# 319. Bulb Switcher

There are n bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs. Then, you turn off every second bulb. On the third round, you toggle every third bulb \(turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on\). For the i-th round, you toggle every i bulb. For the n-th round, you only toggle the last bulb. Find how many bulbs are on after n rounds.

**Example:**

```text
Input: 3
Output: 1 
Explanation: 
At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].
After first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
After second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
After third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off]. 

So you should return 1, because there is only one bulb is on.

### Sol: count number of square numbers

```python
class Solution:
    #A bulb ends up on iff it is switched an odd number of times.
    #Call them bulb 1 to bulb n. Bulb i is switched in round d iff d divides i. So bulb i ends up on iff it has an odd number of divisors.
    #Divisors come in pairs, like i=12 has divisors 1 and 12, 2 and 6, and 3 and 4. Except when i is a square, like 36 has divisors 1 and 36, 2 and 18, 3 and 12, 4 and 9, and double divisor 6. So bulb i ends up on iff i is a square.
    #So just count the square numbers.
    
    def bulbSwitch(self, n: int) -> int:
        return int(n**(0.5))
    
    def bulbSwitch(self, n: int) -> int:
        return sum(self.countDivisors(i) % 2 for i in range(1, n+1))
      
    #divisor 除数， dividend 被除数
    def countDivisors(self, n) : 
        cnt = 0
        for i in range(1, (int)(math.sqrt(n)) + 1) : 
            if n % i == 0:           
                # If divisors are equal count only one, otherwise count both 
                cnt = cnt + 1 if n == i * i else cnt + 2        
        return cnt 
```
