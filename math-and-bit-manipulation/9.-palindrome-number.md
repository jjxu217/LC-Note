# 9. Palindrome Number

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 121
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        if x < 0 or (x % 10 == 0 and x != 0):
            return False
        revertedNumber = 0
        while x > revertedNumber:
            revertedNumber = revertedNumber * 10 + x % 10
            x //= 10       
        # When the length is an odd number, we can get rid of the middle digit by revertedNumber/10
        # For example when the input is 12321, at the end of the while loop we get x = 12, revertedNumber = 123,
        # since the middle digit doesn't matter in palidrome(it will always equal to itself), we can simply get rid of it.
        
        return x == revertedNumber or x == revertedNumber // 10
```
