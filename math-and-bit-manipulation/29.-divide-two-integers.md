## 29. Divide Two Integers

Given two integers `dividend` and `divisor`, divide two integers without using multiplication, division and mod operator.

Return the quotient after dividing `dividend` by `divisor`.

The integer division should truncate toward zero.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
Output: -2
```

```python
class Solution:
    def divide(self, A: int, B: int) -> int:
        if (A == -2 ** 31 and B == -1): return 2 ** 31 -1
        a, b, res = abs(A), abs(B), 0
        for x in range(32)[::-1]:
            if (a >> x) >= b:
                res += 1 << x
                a -= b << x
        return res if (A > 0) == (B > 0) else -res
```



## **Sum/Subtract of Two Integers**

For this, problem, for example, we have a = 1, b = 3,  
****In bit representation, a = 0001, b = 0011,

1. we can use "and"\("&"\) operation between a and b to find a **`carry`**. `carry = a & b`, then carry = 0001 _Why carry is a&b: If a and b are both 1 at the same digit, it creates one carry. Because you can only use 0 and 1 in binary, if you add 1+1 together, it will roll that over to the next digit, and the value will be 0 at this digit. if they are both 0 or only one is 1, it doesn't need to carry._
2. we can use "xor" \("^"\) operation between a and b to find the different bit, and assign it to a, `a = a^b`   _Use ^ operation between a and b to find the different bit, ^ operator is kind of adding a and b together \(a+b\) but ignore the digit that a and b are both 1, because we already took care of this in step1._
3. we shift carry one position left and assign it to b, b = 0010. `b = carry << 1` Iterate until there is no carry \(or b == 0\)

```python
#iteration
def getSum(a, b):
	if not a or not b:
		return a or b
	while b != 0:
		carry = a & b
		a = a ^ b
		b = carry << 1
	return a
	
def getSum(a, b):
    return getSum(a^b, (a&b)<<1) if b else a
    
    
# Iterative a - b = a + (-b)
def getSubtract(a, b) {
	b = (~b) + 1
	return getSum(a, b)
```
