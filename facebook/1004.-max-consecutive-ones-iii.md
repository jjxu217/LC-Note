# 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III

Given an array `A` of 0s and 1s, we may change up to `K` values from 0 to 1.

Return the length of the longest \(contiguous\) subarray that contains only 1s. 

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: 
[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: 
[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
```

#### **Intuition:** Find the longest subarray with at most `K` zeros.

#### **Explanation**

For each `A[j]`, try to find the longest subarray.  
If `A[i] ~ A[j]` has zeros &lt;= `K`, we continue to increment `j`.  
If `A[i] ~ A[j]` has zeros &gt; `K`, we increment `i`.

```python
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, A, K):
        res = l = 0
        for r in range(len(A)):
            K -= A[r] == 0
            while K < 0:
                K += A[l] == 0
                l += 1
            res = max(res, r - l + 1)
        return res
```

## 487. Max Consecutive Ones II

flip at most one 0.

## 485. Max Consecutive Ones

Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = cur = 0
        for n in nums:
            if n:
                cur += 1
            else:
                cur = 0
            res = max(cur, res)
        return res
```
