# 477. Total Hamming Distance

The [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Now your job is to find the total Hamming distance between all pairs of the given numbers.

**Example:**  


```text
Input: 4, 14, 2

Output: 6

Explanation: In binary representation, the 4 is 0100, 14 is 1110, and 2 is 0010 (just
showing the four bits relevant in this case). So the answer will be:
HammingDistance(4, 14) + HammingDistance(4, 2) + HammingDistance(14, 2) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
```

### Count the number of '0' and '1' in every bit pos.

Notice the total hamming distance is the sum of the total hamming distance for each of the i-th bits separately. Consider the i-th column, which consists of numbers chosen from {0, 1}. The total hamming distance would be the number of pairs of numbers that are different. That is,

**Total hamming distance for the i-th bit = \(the number of zeros in the i-th position\) \*  
\(the number of ones in the i-th position\).**

We then add all of these together to get our answer.

```python
class Solution:
    def totalHammingDistance(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        #bits[i] is [number of '0', number of '1']
        bits = [[0,0] for _ in range(32)]
        for n in nums:
            for bit in bits:
                bit[n & 1] += 1
                n >>= 1
        return sum( x*y for x,y in bits )
```
