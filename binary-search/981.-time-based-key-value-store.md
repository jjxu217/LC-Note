# 981. Time Based Key-Value Store

Create a timebased key-value store class `TimeMap`, that supports two operations.

1. `set(string key, string value, int timestamp)`

* Stores the `key` and `value`, along with the given `timestamp`.

2. `get(string key, int timestamp)`

* Returns a value such that `set(key, value, timestamp_prev)` was called previously, with `timestamp_prev <= timestamp`.
* If there are multiple such values, it returns the one with the largest `timestamp_prev`.
* If there are no values, it returns the empty string \(`""`\).

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: inputs = ["TimeMap","set","get","get","set","get","get"], inputs = [[],["foo","bar",1],["foo",1],["foo",3],["foo","bar2",4],["foo",4],["foo",5]]
Output: [null,null,"bar","bar",null,"bar2","bar2"]
Explanation:   
TimeMap kv;   
kv.set("foo", "bar", 1); // store the key "foo" and value "bar" along with timestamp = 1   
kv.get("foo", 1);  // output "bar"   
kv.get("foo", 3); // output "bar" since there is no value corresponding to foo at timestamp 3 and timestamp 2, then the only value is at timestamp 1 ie "bar"   
kv.set("foo", "bar2", 4);   
kv.get("foo", 4); // output "bar2"   
kv.get("foo", 5); //output "bar2"   

```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: inputs = ["TimeMap","set","set","get","get","get","get","get"], inputs = [[],["love","high",10],["love","low",20],["love",5],["love",10],["love",15],["love",20],["love",25]]
Output: [null,null,null,"","high","high","low","low"]
```

**Note:**

1. All key/value strings are lowercase.
2. All key/value strings have length in the range `[1, 100]`
3. The `timestamps` for all `TimeMap.set` operations are strictly increasing.
4. `1 <= timestamp <= 10^7`
5. `TimeMap.set` and `TimeMap.get` functions will be called a total of `120000` times \(combined\) per test case.

### Solution: two dicts {key:\[timestamp\]}, {key:\[value\]}, first find the correct idx in timestamp, then look up the value in \[value\]

The timestamp is in ascending order!  
i = bisect.bisect\_right\(list, key\), find the position on the right  
the element is at `i-1` in `[value]`

```python
import bisect
class TimeMap:
    def __init__(self):
        self.times = collections.defaultdict(list)
        self.values = collections.defaultdict(list)
        
    def set(self, key: str, value: str, timestamp: int) -> None:
        self.times[key].append(timestamp)
        self.values[key].append(value)
        
    def get(self, key: str, timestamp: int) -> str:
        i = bisect.bisect_right(self.times[key], timestamp)
        return self.values[key][i-1] if i else ""

# Your TimeMap object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = TimeMap()
# obj.set(key,value,timestamp)
# param_2 = obj.get(key,timestamp)
```
