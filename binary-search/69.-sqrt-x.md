# 69. Sqrt\(x\)

Implement `int sqrt(int x)`.

Compute and return the square root of _x_, where _x_ is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

### Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        if x == 0: return 0
        left, right = 1, x
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if mid * mid <= x and (mid + 1) * (mid + 1) > x:
                return mid
            elif (mid + 1) * (mid + 1) <= x:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
```
