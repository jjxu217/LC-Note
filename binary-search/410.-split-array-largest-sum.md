# 410. Split Array Largest Sum 1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days

Given an array which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m, you can split the array into m non-empty continuous subarrays. Write an algorithm to **minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays**. 

**Note:**  
If n is the length of array, assume the following constraints are satisfied:

**Examples:**

```text
Input:
nums = [7,2,5,10,8]
m = 2

Output:
18
Explanation:
There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8],
where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
```

### Sol: 因为判断一个数是否满足条件\(largest sum among these m subarrays\)很简单, 考虑bisect搜索满足条件的最小值; 搜索域：最小可能是max\(nums\), 最大可能是sum\(nums\), 

```python
class Solution:
    def splitArray(self, nums: List[int], m: int) -> int:     
        def isvalid(n):
            cur = cnt = 0
            for w in nums:
                if cur + w <= n:
                    cur += w
                else:
                    cnt += 1
                    cur = w
                    if cnt >= D: #equality!!cnt is current ship used!
                        return False
            return True
                
        l, r = max(nums), sum(nums)
        while l < r:
            mid = l + (r - l) // 2
            if isValid(mid):
                r = mid
            else:
                l = mid + 1
        return l
```

### DP

Let's define `f[i][j]` to be the minimum largest subarray sum for splitting `nums[0..i]` into `j` parts.

Consider the `j`th subarray. We can split the array from a smaller index `k` to `i` to form it. Thus `dp[i][j]` can be derived from `max(f[k][j - 1], sum(nums[k+1:i+1]), for k in range(i)`, `dp[i][j]` should choose the minimum value of the above formula.

The final answer should be `f[n][m]`, where `n` is the size of the array.

For corner situations, all the invalid `f[i][j]` should be assigned with `INFINITY`, and `f[0][0]` should be initialized with `0`.

```python
def splitArray(self, nums: List[int], m: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)       
        dp = [[float('inf')] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        prefix = [0] + nums
        for i in range(n):
            prefix[i + 1] += prefix[i]
        dp[0][0] = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, m + 1):
                for k in range(i):
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], max(dp[k][j - 1], prefix[i] - prefix[k]))
        return dp[-1][-1]
```

## 1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days

A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within `D` days.

The `i`-th package on the conveyor belt has a weight of `weights[i]`.  Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt \(in the order given by `weights`\). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.

Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within `D` days.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed. 
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], D = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: 
1st day: 1
2nd day: 2
3rd day: 3
4th day: 1, 1
```

```python
class Solution:
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:
        def isvalid(n):
            cur = cnt = 0
            for w in weights:
                if cur + w <= n:
                    cur += w
                else:
                    cnt += 1
                    cur = w
                    if cnt >= D: #equality!!cnt is current ship used!
                        return False
            return True
        
        l, r = max(weights), sum(weights)
        while l < r:
            mid = l + (r - l) // 2
            if isvalid(mid):
                r = mid
            else:
                l = mid + 1
        return r
```

## Chocolate Sweetness

Given an array `chocolate` of `n` non-negative integers, where the values are sweetness levels of the chocolate. You are also given a value `k` which denotes the number of friends you will share this chocolate with. Your friends are greedy so they will always take the highest sweetness chunk. Find out what is the maximum sweetness level you could get.

Split the array into `k` non-empty continuous subarrays. Write an algorithm to **maximize the minimum sum among these `k` subarrays.**

**Example:**

```text
Input: chocolate = [6, 3, 2, 8, 7, 5], k = 3
Output: 9
Explanation:
The values in array are sweetness level in each chunk of chocolate. Since k = 3, so you have to divide this array in 3 pieces,
such that you would get maximum out of the minimum sweetness level. So, you should divide this array in
[6, 3] -> 6 + 3 = 9
[2, 8] -> 2 + 8 = 10
[7, 5] -> 7 + 5 = 12
Your other two friends will take the sweetest chunk, so they will take 12 and 10. The maximum sweetness level you could get is 9.
```

### bisect: O\(n \* log \(sum - min\)\)

```python
def chocolateSweetness(A, K):
    def isValid(x):
        cnt = cur = 0
        for a in A:
            cur += a
            if cur >= x:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
        return cnt >= K
    
    l, h = min(A), sum(A)
    while l < h:
        m = (l + h + 1) // 2
        if isValid(m):
            l = m
        else:
            h = m - 1
    return l


A = [6, 3, 2, 8, 7, 5]
K = 3
print(chocolateSweetness(A, K), 9)
```
