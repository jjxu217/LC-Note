# 287. Find the Duplicate Number

Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n \(inclusive\), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

**Note:**

1. You **must not** modify the array \(assume the array is read only\).
2. You must use only constant, O\(1\) extra space.
3. Your runtime complexity should be less than _O_\(_n_2\).
4. There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

```python
class Solution:
    #sort
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                return nums[i]
            
 
    #Same as linked list cycle II
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        slow = fast = finder = 0
        while True:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[nums[fast]]
            if slow == fast:
                while finder != slow:
                    finder = nums[finder]
                    slow = nums[slow]
                return finder
            
    #The solution is applying bi-search in the range[1, n] by counting the element which falls     in sub range(n/2, n].
    # If the number is bigger than capacity of that sub range, it means the duplicated integer falls in the sub-range.
    #Otherwise the duplicated integer falls in the other half sub range.     
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 1, len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:
            cnt = 0
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            for i in nums:
                if mid < i <= right:
                    cnt += 1
            if cnt > right - mid:
                left = mid + 1
            else: right = mid
        return right
    
   
```
