## 287. Find the Duplicate Number

Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n \(inclusive\), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

**Note:**

1. You **must not** modify the array \(assume the array is read only\).
2. You must use only constant, O\(1\) extra space.
3. Your runtime complexity should be less than _O_\(_n_2\).
4. There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

```python
class Solution:
    #sort
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                return nums[i]
            
 
    #Same as linked list cycle II
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        slow = fast = finder = 0
        while True:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[nums[fast]]
            if slow == fast:
                while finder != slow:
                    finder = nums[finder]
                    slow = nums[slow]
                return finder
            
    #The solution is applying bi-search in the range[1, n] by counting the element which falls     in sub range(n/2, n].
    # If the number is bigger than capacity of that sub range, it means the duplicated integer falls in the sub-range.
    #Otherwise the duplicated integer falls in the other half sub range.     
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 1, len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:
            cnt = 0
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            for i in nums:
                if mid < i <= right:
                    cnt += 1
            if cnt > right - mid:
                left = mid + 1
            else: right = mid
        return right
```



## 142. Linked List Cycle II

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position \(0-indexed\) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

**Note:** Do not modify the linked list.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

### Sol:

1. first: slow/fast find the node encountered

2. one pointer from head, the other starts from the encountered node, find the entrance, since `F = b`

```python
class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        slow = fast = finder = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if slow == fast:
                while finder != slow:
                    finder = finder.next
                    slow = slow.next
                return finder
        return None
```
