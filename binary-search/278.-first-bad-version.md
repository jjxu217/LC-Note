# 278. First Bad Version

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which will return whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Example:**

```text
Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.

call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true

Then 4 is the first bad version. 
```

### Solution1: Temp3

```python
class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n:int): ->int
        left, right = 1, n
        while left < right - 1:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if isBadVersion(mid):
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid 
        return left if isBadVersion(left) else right
```

### Solution1: Temp2

```python
class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n:int): ->int
        left, right = 1, n
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if isBadVersion(mid):
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
```
