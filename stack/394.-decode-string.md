# 394/443 Decode/Compress String

## 394. Decode String

Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the encoded\_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like `3a` or `2[4]`.

**Examples:**

```text
s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".
```

```python
class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = [['', 1]] # cur chars and number of repeated time
        num = ''
        for ch in s:
            if ch.isdigit():
                num += ch
            elif ch == '[':
                stack.append(['', int(num)])
                num = ''  #set to empty
            elif ch == ']':
                cur, cnt = stack.pop()
                stack[-1][0] += cur*cnt #add cur string to previous one
            else:
                stack[-1][0] += ch
        return stack[-1][0]
```

## 443. String Compression

Given an array of characters, compress it [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm).

The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.

Every element of the array should be a **character** \(not int\) of length 1.

After you are done **modifying the input array** [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm), return the new length of the array. 

**Follow up:**  
Could you solve it using only O\(1\) extra space? 

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:
["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]

Output:
Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]

Explanation:
"aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input:
["a"]

Output:
Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]

Explanation:
Nothing is replaced.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input:
["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]

Output:
Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].

Explanation:
Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbbbbbbbbbbb" is replaced by "b12".
Notice each digit has it's own entry in the array.
```

### **Solutions: Two Pointers:**

the element on the left of _`left`_ is solution

```python
     def compress(self, chars: List[str]) -> int:
        left = i = 0
        while i < len(chars):
            char, length = chars[i], 1
            #next ele is valid and is the same as current one, the length++, i++
            while i + 1 < len(chars) and char == chars[i + 1]:
                i += 1
                length += 1
            chars[left] = char
            left += 1
            if length > 1:
                chars[left:left + len(str(length))] = str(length)
                left += len(str(length))
            i += 1
        return left
```
