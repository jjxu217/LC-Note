# 394. Decode String

Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the encoded\_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like `3a` or `2[4]`.

**Examples:**

```text
s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".
```

```python
class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = [['', 1]] # cur chars and number of repeated time
        num = ''
        for ch in s:
            if ch.isdigit():
                num += ch
            elif ch == '[':
                stack.append(['', int(num)])
                num = ''  #set to empty
            elif ch == ']':
                cur, cnt = stack.pop()
                stack[-1][0] += cur*cnt #add cur string to previous one
            else:
                stack[-1][0] += ch
        return stack[-1][0]
```
