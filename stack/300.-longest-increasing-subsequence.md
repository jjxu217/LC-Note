# 300/673/674 Longest Increasing Subsequence

## 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

**Example:**

```text
Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 
```

### Sol1: dp: maintain a ascending sub-sequence, insert with binary search

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        sub = []
        for n in nums:
            idx = bisect.bisect_left(sub, n)
            if idx == len(sub):
                sub.append(n)
            else:
                sub[idx] = n
        return len(sub)
```

### Sol2: DP, time=O\(n^2\), represent the length of the LIS up to i index

```python
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums: return 0
        dp = [1] * len(nums)
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)       
        return max(dp)
```

## 673. Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing subsequence.

**Example 1:**  


```text
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequence are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
```

### Idea: DP,  update two lists: one record the longest distance end at i\(included\), one record the counts

```python
class Solution:
    def findNumberOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        N = len(nums)
        if N <= 1: return N
        lengths = [0] * N #lengths[i] = longest ending in nums[i]
        cnt = [1] * N #cnt[i] = number of longest ending in nums[i]
        
        for r, n in enumerate(nums):
            for l in range(r):
                if nums[l] < nums[r]:
                    if lengths[l] >= lengths[r]:
                        lengths[r] = lengths[l] + 1
                        cnt[r] = cnt[l]
                    elif lengths[l] + 1 == lengths[r]:
                        cnt[r] += cnt[l]
        longest = max(lengths)
        return sum(c for i, c in enumerate(cnt) if lengths[i] == longest)
```

## 674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest `continuous` increasing subsequence \(subarray\).

**Example 1:**  


```text
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 
```

### Idea: one pass

```python
class Solution:
    def findLengthOfLCIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums: return 0
        dp = [1] * len(nums)
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > nums[i - 1]:
                dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1
        return max(dp)
```
