# 636. Exclusive Time of Functions

On a **single threaded** CPU, we execute some functions.  Each function has a unique id between `0` and `N-1`.

We store logs in timestamp order that describe when a function is entered or exited.

Each log is a string with this format: `"{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}"`.  For example, `"0:start:3"` means the function with id `0` **started at the beginning** of timestamp `3`.  `"1:end:2"` means the function with id `1` **ended at the end** of timestamp `2`.

A function's _exclusive time_ is the number of units of time spent in this function.  Note that this does **not** include any recursive calls to child functions.

The CPU is **single threaded** which means that only one function is being executed at a given time unit.

Return the exclusive time of each function, sorted by their function id.

**Example 1:**

Input:
n = 2
logs = ["0:start:0","1:start:2","1:end:5","0:end:6"]
Output: [3, 4]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 units of time and reaches the end of time 1.
Now function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes 4 units of time and ends at time 5.
Function 0 is running again at the beginning of time 6, and also ends at the end of time 6, thus executing for 1 unit of time. 
So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.
```

### Sol: using `stack` 存当前未结束程序的`idx`, `stack[-1]`是当前在当前time之前运行的程序； pre\_time is the \(re\)beginning time of a function

**iterate all event:  
when new function start, we add `time-pre_time` to the previous function.** `stack.append(idx); pre_time = time`  
**when cur function end, we add `time-pre_time + 1` to cur function and end cur function** `ans[stack.pop()] += time - pre_time + 1 pre_time = time + 1`

```python
class Solution:
    def exclusiveTime(self, n: int, logs: List[str]) -> List[int]:
        ans = [0] * n
        stack = [] #store executive function idx
        pre_time = 0 
        
        for log in logs:
            idx, status, time = log.split(':')
            idx, time = int(idx), int(time)
            
            #when new task starts
            if status == 'start': 
                #add pre task time
                if stack:
                    ans[stack[-1]] += time - pre_time 
                stack.append(idx)
                pre_time = time
            else: #task end
                #add cur task time and end cur task
                ans[stack.pop()] += time - pre_time + 1 
                pre_time = time + 1
        return ans        
```
