# 73. Set Matrix Zeroes

Given a _m_ x _n_ matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Do it [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm).

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 
[
  [1,1,1],
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,1]
]
Output: 
[
  [1,0,1],
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1]
]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: 
[
  [0,1,2,0],
  [3,4,5,2],
  [1,3,1,5]
]
Output: 
[
  [0,0,0,0],
  [0,4,5,0],
  [0,3,1,0]
]
```

### Sol1: marked with '\#'

```python
class Solution:
    def setZeroes(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                    for I in range(m):
                        if matrix[I][j] != 0:
                            matrix[I][j] = '#'
                    for J in range(n):
                        if matrix[i][J] != 0: 
                            matrix[i][J] = '#'
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if matrix[i][j] == '#':
                    matrix[i][j] = 0
```

### Sol2: use first row/col as flag

`if cell[i][j] == 0: cell[i][0] = cell[0][j] = 0`

The first cell of row and column for the first row and first column is the same i.e. cell\[0\]\[0\]. Hence, use an additional variable to tell if the first column had been marked or not and the cell\[0\]\[0\] would be used to tell the same for the first row.
