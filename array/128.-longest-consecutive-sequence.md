# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O\(_n_\) complexity.

**Example:**

```text
Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

### IDea: convert list to set, search for consecutive sequence, time=o\(n\)

```text
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums = set(nums)
        best = 0
        for x in nums:
            if x - 1 not in nums:
                y = x + 1
                while y in nums:
                    y += 1
                best = max(best, y - x)
        return best
```

### Union-Find, the consecutive number are seen as connected.
