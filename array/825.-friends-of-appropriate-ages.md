# 825. Friends Of Appropriate Ages

Some people will make friend requests. The list of their ages is given and `ages[i]` is the age of the ith person. 

Person A will NOT friend request person B \(B != A\) if any of the following conditions are true:

* `age[B] <= 0.5 * age[A] + 7`
* `age[B] > age[A]`
* `age[B] > 100 && age[A] < 100`

Otherwise, A will friend request B.

Note that if A requests B, B does not necessarily request A.  Also, people will not friend request themselves.

How many total friend requests are made?

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [16,16]
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 people friend request each other.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [16,17,18]
Output: 2
Explanation: Friend requests are made 17 -> 16, 18 -> 17.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: [20,30,100,110,120]
Output: 
Explanation: Friend requests are made 110 -> 100, 120 -> 110, 120 -> 100.
```

Notes:

* `1 <= ages.length <= 20000`.
* `1 <= ages[i] <= 120`.

### Sol: use counter or use a list = \[0\]\*121, 同一age 集中处理

```python
class Solution:
    def numFriendRequests(self, ages: List[int]) -> int:
        count = collections.Counter(ages)
        ans = 0
        for ageA, countA in count.items():
            for ageB, countB in count.items():
                if ageA * 0.5 + 7 >= ageB or ageA < ageB or ageA < 100 < ageB: 
                    continue
                ans += countA * countB
                if ageA == ageB: ans -= countA
        return ans
```
