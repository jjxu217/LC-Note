# 135. Candy

There are _N_ children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

* Each child must have at least one candy.
* Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

What is the minimum candies you must give?

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
             The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

### SOLï¼štwo pass, left to right, right to left update array

```python
class Solution:
    #two pass
    #first consider only left side, if ratings larger than left side, candy += 1; then consider right side, update candies
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(ratings)
        candies = [1]*n
        #only consider left neigh, if ratings larger than left side, candy += 1
        for i in range(1, n): 
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]:
                candies[i] = candies[i-1] + 1
        #only consider right neigh, if ratings larger than left side, candy += 1 if needed
        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1): 
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i+1]:
                candies[i] = max(candies[i+1] + 1, candies[i])
        return sum(candies) #take the sum
