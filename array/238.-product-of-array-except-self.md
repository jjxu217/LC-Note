# 238. Product of Array Except Self

Given an array `nums` of _n_ integers where _n_ &gt; 1,  return an array `output` such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

**Example:**

```text
Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

**Note:** Please solve it **without division** and in O\(_n_\).

**Follow up:**  
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? \(The output array **does not** count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.\)

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        res = [1] * n
        for i in range(1, n):
            res[i] = nums[i - 1] * res[i - 1]
        p = 1
        for i in reversed(range(n)):
            res[i] *= p
            p *= nums[i]
        return res
```
