# 561. Array Partition I

Given an array of **2n** integers, your task is to group these integers into **n** pairs of integer, say \(a1, b1\), \(a2, b2\), ..., \(an, bn\) which makes sum of min\(ai, bi\) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [1,4,3,2]

Output: 4
Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3, 4).
```

We need to form the pairings of the array's elements such that the overall sum of the minimum out of such pairings is maximum. Thus, we can look at the operation of choosing the minimum out of the pairing, say \(a, b\) as incurring a loss of aâˆ’b\(if aa&gt;b\), in the maximum sum possible.

```python
class Solution:
    def arrayPairSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        return sum(nums[0:len(nums):2])
```
