# 605. Can Place Flowers

Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.

Given a flowerbed \(represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty\), and a number **n**, return if **n** new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

**Example 1:**  


```text
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: True
```

**Example 2:**  


```text
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: False
```

```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        for i in range(len(flowerbed)):
            if flowerbed[i] == 0 and (i == 0 or flowerbed[i - 1] == 0) and (i == len(flowerbed) - 1 or flowerbed[i + 1] == 0):
                flowerbed[i] = 1
                n -= 1
        return n <= 0
```
