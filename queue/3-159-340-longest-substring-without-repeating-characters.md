# 3/159/340 Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters 438. Find All Anagrams in a String

## 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

### Sol: sliding window

Use a **dic** to record the used char and the position, use **l** to record the left side of non-repeat char.

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        l = res = 0
        dic = {}
        for i, ch in enumerate(s):
            if ch in dic:
                l = max(l, dic[ch] + 1)
            res = max(res, i - l + 1)
            dic[ch] = i
        return res
```

## 159. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters

Given a string _**s**_ , find the length of the longest substring _**t**_  that contains **at most** 2 distinct characters.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: "eceba"
Output: 3
Explanation: t is "ece" which its length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: "ccaabbb"
Output: 5
Explanation: t is "aabbb" which its length is 5.
```

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(self, s: str) -> int:     
        l = res = 0
        dic = {}
        for i, ch in enumerate(s):
            dic[ch] = i
            if len(dic) == 3:
                del_idx = min(dic.values())
                del dic[s[del_idx]]
                l = del_idx + 1
            res = max(res, i - l + 1)
        return res
```

## 340. Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        l = res = 0
        dic = {}
        for i, ch in enumerate(s):
            dic[ch] = i
            if len(dic) == k + 1:
                del_idx = min(dic.values())
                del dic[s[del_idx]]
                l = del_idx + 1
            res = max(res, i - l + 1)
        return res
```

## 438. Find All Anagrams in a String

Given a string **s** and a **non-empty** string **p**, find all the start indices of **p**'s anagrams in **s**.

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings **s** and **p** will not be larger than 20,100.

The order of output does not matter.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:
s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"

Output:
[0, 6]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input:
s: "abab" p: "ab"

Output:
[0, 1, 2]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
        pCounter = collections.Counter(p)
        sCounter = collections.Counter(s[:len(p)-1])
        res = []
        for i in range(len(s) - len(p) + 1):
            sCounter[s[i + len(p) - 1]] += 1 # include a new char in the window
            if sCounter == pCounter: # This step is O(1), since there are at most 26 English letters 
                res.append(i)
            sCounter[s[i]] -= 1 # decrease the count of oldest char in the window
            if sCounter[s[i]] == 0:
                del sCounter[s[i]]  # remove the count if it is 0
        return res
```
