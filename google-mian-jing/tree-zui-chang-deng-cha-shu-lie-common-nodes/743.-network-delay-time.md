# 743. Network Delay Time

There are `N` network nodes, labelled `1` to `N`.

Given `times`, a list of travel times as **directed** edges `times[i] = (u, v, w)`, where `u` is the source node, `v` is the target node, and `w` is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

Now, we send a signal from a certain node `K`. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], N = 4, K = 2
Output: 2
```

**Note:**

1. `N` will be in the range `[1, 100]`.
2. `K` will be in the range `[1, N]`.
3. The length of `times` will be in the range `[1, 6000]`.
4. All edges `times[i] = (u, v, w)` will have `1 <= u, v <= N` and `0 <= w <= 100`.

### Dijkstra, time = O\(\(V+E\)logV\)

```python
class Solution:
    def networkDelayTime(self, times: List[List[int]], N: int, K: int) -> int:
        #build the graph
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for u, v, w in times:
            graph[u].append((v, w))
            
        dist = [0] + [-1] * N
        h = [(0, K)]
        while h:
            d, cur = heapq.heappop(h)
            #if cur node is not expand, expand it
            if dist[cur] == -1:
                dist[cur] = d #set the dist
                #generate not-yet-expanded neigh node
                for nei, d2 in graph[cur]:
                    if dist[nei] == -1:
                        heapq.heappush(h, (d + d2, nei))
        return max(dist) if all(d != -1 for d in dist) else -1
```

#### 如果是给一个tree的话，类似找max depth

## 559. Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree

You have been given a CEO node under which there are various employees, and the are connected to the CEO with a tube which indicates time it takes to transfer the note , under these employees again there are several employees connected with a tube with the time it takes to reach the note.

Return that time at which all employees have received the notes.

```text
example :
  
      7
    A--CEO
    5 /   \3
    B      D
6 / 
 C
return 18
Note : there was no left or right pointer, just a child pointer. So, you can probably traverse the tree using that pointer.
```

### **Base case:  If node is None, return 0;  if node.children is None, which is leaf node, return weight**

```python
class Node:
    self.children = []
    self.weight = 0
    
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: 'Node') -> int:
        if not root: return 0
        if not root.children: return root.weight
        return max(self.maxDepth(c) for c in root.children) + root.weight
```
