## 482. License Key Formatting

You are given a license key represented as a string S which consists only alphanumeric character and dashes. The string is separated into N+1 groups by N dashes.

Given a number K, we would want to reformat the strings such that each group contains exactly K characters, except for the first group which could be shorter than K, but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups and all lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.

Given a non-empty string S and a number K, format the string according to the rules described above.

**Example 1:**  


```text
Input: S = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", K = 4

Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"

Explanation: The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
```

**Example 2:**  


```text
Input: S = "2-5g-3-J", K = 2

Output: "2-5G-3J"

Explanation: The string S has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.
```

```python
class Solution:
    def licenseKeyFormatting(self, S: str, K: int) -> str:
        S = S.replace("-", "").upper()[::-1]
        return '-'.join(S[i:i+K] for i in range(0, len(S), K))[::-1]
```

## 1170. Compare Strings by Frequency of the Smallest Character

Let's define a function `f(s)` over a non-empty string `s`, which calculates the frequency of the smallest character in `s`. For example, if `s = "dcce"` then `f(s) = 2` because the smallest character is `"c"` and its frequency is 2.

Now, given string arrays `queries` and `words`, return an integer array `answer`, where each `answer[i]` is the number of words such that `f(queries[i])` &lt; `f(W)`, where `W` is a word in `words`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: queries = ["cbd"], words = ["zaaaz"]
Output: [1]
Explanation: On the first query we have f("cbd") = 1, f("zaaaz") = 3 so f("cbd") < f("zaaaz").
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: queries = ["bbb","cc"], words = ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: On the first query only f("bbb") < f("aaaa"). On the second query both f("aaa") and f("aaaa") are both > f("cc").
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numSmallerByFrequency(self, queries: List[str], words: List[str]) -> List[int]:
        f = sorted(w.count(min(w)) for w in words)
        return [len(f) - bisect.bisect(f, q.count(min(q))) for q in queries]
```

## 848. Backspace String Compare

Given two strings `S` and `T`, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. `#` means a backspace character.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "ac".
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: S = "ab##", T = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "".
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: S = "a##c", T = "#a#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "c".
```

**Example 4:**

```text
Input: S = "a#c", T = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: S becomes "c" while T becomes "b".
```

```python
class Solution:
    def backspaceCompare(self, S: str, T: str) -> bool:
        l1 = self.stack(S, [])
        l2 = self.stack(T, [])
        return l1 == l2        
    
    def stack(self, S, stack):
        for char in S:
            if char is not "#":
                stack.append(char)
            else:
                if stack:
                    stack.pop()
        return stack
```

## 844. Backspace String Compare

Given two strings `S` and `T`, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. `#` means a backspace character.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "ac".
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: S = "ab##", T = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "".
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: S = "a##c", T = "#a#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "c".
```

**Example 4:**

```text
Input: S = "a#c", T = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: S becomes "c" while T becomes "b".
```

```python
class Solution:
    def backspaceCompare(self, S: str, T: str) -> bool:
        l1 = self.stack(S, [])
        l2 = self.stack(T, [])
        return l1 == l2        
    
    def stack(self, S, stack):
        for char in S:
            if char is not "#":
                stack.append(char)
            else:
                if stack:
                    stack.pop()
        return stack
    
    #O(1) space
    # The idea is that, read next letter from end to start.
    # If we meet '#', we increase the number we need to step back, until back = 0
    def backspaceCompare(self, S, T):
        i, j = len(S) - 1, len(T) - 1
        backS = backT = 0
        while True:
            while i >= 0 and (backS or S[i] == '#'):
                backS += 1 if S[i] == '#' else -1
                i -= 1
            while j >= 0 and (backT or T[j] == '#'):
                backT += 1 if T[j] == '#' else -1
                j -= 1
            if i < 0 or j < 0 or S[i] != T[j]:
                return i == j == -1
            i, j = i - 1, j - 1
```

## 359. Logger Rate Limiter

Design a logger system that receive stream of messages along with its timestamps, each message should be printed if and only if it is **not printed in the last 10 seconds**.

Given a message and a timestamp \(in seconds granularity\), return true if the message should be printed in the given timestamp, otherwise returns false.

It is possible that several messages arrive roughly at the same time.

**Example:**

```text
Logger logger = new Logger();

// logging string "foo" at timestamp 1
logger.shouldPrintMessage(1, "foo"); returns true; 

// logging string "bar" at timestamp 2
logger.shouldPrintMessage(2,"bar"); returns true;

// logging string "foo" at timestamp 3
logger.shouldPrintMessage(3,"foo"); returns false;

// logging string "bar" at timestamp 8
logger.shouldPrintMessage(8,"bar"); returns false;

// logging string "foo" at timestamp 10
logger.shouldPrintMessage(10,"foo"); returns false;

// logging string "foo" at timestamp 11
logger.shouldPrintMessage(11,"foo"); returns true;
```

```python
class Logger:

    def __init__(self):
        self.d = {}

    def shouldPrintMessage(self, timestamp, message):
        if message in self.d and timestamp - self.d[message] < 10:
            return False
        else:
            self.d[message] = timestamp
            return True
```

## 890. Find and Replace Pattern

You have a list of `words` and a `pattern`, and you want to know which words in `words` matches the pattern.

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters `p` so that after replacing every letter `x` in the pattern with `p(x)`, we get the desired word.

\(_Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter._\)

Return a list of the words in `words` that match the given pattern. 

You may return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
Output: ["mee","aqq"]
Explanation: "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}. 
"ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation,
since a and b map to the same letter.
```

### Normalize a string to a standard pattern

```python
class Solution:
    def findAndReplacePattern(self, w: List[str], p: str) -> List[str]:
        def F(w):
            m = {}
            return [m.setdefault(c, len(m)) for c in w]
        Fp = F(p)
        return [w for w in words if F(w) == Fp]
        
F('aabc')
>>[0, 0, 1, 2]
```
