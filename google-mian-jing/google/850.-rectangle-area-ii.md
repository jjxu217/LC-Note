# 850. Rectangle Area II

We are given a list of \(axis-aligned\) `rectangles`.  Each `rectangle[i] = [x1, y1, x2, y2]` , where \(x1, y1\) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and \(x2, y2\) are the coordinates of the top-right corner of the `i`th rectangle.

Find the total area covered by all `rectangles` in the plane.  Since the answer may be too large, **return it modulo 10^9 + 7**.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [[0,0,2,2],[1,0,2,3],[1,0,3,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: As illustrated in the picture.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [[0,0,1000000000,1000000000]]
Output: 49
Explanation: The answer is 10^18 modulo (10^9 + 7), which is (10^9)^2 = (-7)^2 = 49.
```

### **Explanation**: line sweep

Scan from `y = 0`, count the coverage of rectangles on `x`.  
For example, at `y = 0`, the intervale \[0, 3\] is covered by rectangles.  
The current sum of coverage is 3.

Then we move our scan line upper to next `y`.  
At `y = 1`, we add \(1 - 0\) \* 3 = 3 to area. Now area = 3.  
And we update the sum of coverage to 2 because it's coverd on \[0, 2\].

Then we move our scan line upper to next `y`.  
At `y = 2`, we add \(2 - 1\) \* 2 = 2 to area. Now area = 5.  
And we update the sum of coverage to 1 because it's coverd on \[1, 2\].

Then we move our scan line upper to next `y`.  
At `y = 3`, we add \(3 - 2\) \* 1 = 1 to area. Now area = 6.  
And we update the sum of coverage to 0.

The final result is 6.

**Time Complexity**:  
We checked every `y` value, and for every `y`, we count the coverage of `x`.  
So this a O\(N^2\) solution.

```python
class Solution:
    def rectangleArea(self, rectangles):
        xs = sorted(set([x for x1, y1, x2, y2 in rectangles for x in [x1, x2]] + [0]))
        x_i = {v: i for i, v in enumerate(xs)}
        count = [0] * len(x_i)
        L = []
        for x1, y1, x2, y2 in rectangles:
            L.append([y1, x1, x2, 1])
            L.append([y2, x1, x2, -1])
        L.sort()
        cur_y = cur_x_sum = area = 0
        for y, x1, x2, sig in L:
            area += (y - cur_y) * cur_x_sum
            cur_y = y
            for i in range(x_i[x1], x_i[x2]):
                count[i] += sig
            cur_x_sum = sum(x2 - x1 if c else 0 for x1, x2, c in zip(xs, xs[1:], count))
        return area % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

**Follow Up Time**  
Can you do it better in O\(NlogN\)?

When I update the coverage on x, I updated one by one.  
But in fact I update for a range.  
If we use a segment tree to update the coverage, it will be only O\(logN\) for add and delete action.

**Python:**

```python
    def rectangleArea(self, rectangles):
        xs = sorted(set([x for x1, y1, x2, y2 in rectangles for x in [x1, x2]] + [0]))
        st = NumArray(xs)
        L = []
        for x1, y1, x2, y2 in rectangles:
            L.append([y1, 1, x1, x2])
            L.append([y2, -1, x1, x2])
        L.sort()
        cur_y = cur_x_sum = area = 0
        for y, sig, x1, x2 in L:
            area += (y - cur_y) * cur_x_sum
            cur_y = y
            cur_x_sum = st.update(x1, x2, sig)
        return area % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```
