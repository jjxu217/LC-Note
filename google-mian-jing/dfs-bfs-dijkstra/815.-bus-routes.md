# 815. Bus Routes

We have a list of bus routes. Each `routes[i]` is a bus route that the i-th bus repeats forever. For example if `routes[0] = [1, 5, 7]`, this means that the first bus \(0-th indexed\) travels in the sequence 1-&gt;5-&gt;7-&gt;1-&gt;5-&gt;7-&gt;1-&gt;... forever.

We start at bus stop `S` \(initially not on a bus\), and we want to go to bus stop `T`. Travelling by buses only, what is the least number of buses we must take to reach our destination? Return -1 if it is not possible.

Example:
Input: 
routes = [[1, 2, 7], [3, 6, 7]]
S = 1
T = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The best strategy is take the first bus to the bus stop 7, then take the second bus to the bus stop 6.
```

### Sol: BFS, on a bipartite graph

Bipartite graph: stop on one side, bus on one side. `routes` is the edge from bus to stop. First build the graph, add the edges from stop to bus `stop2bus`.

1. **Build the graph**: Loop on routes and record stop to buses mapping in `stop2bus`.
2. **BFS**. Since each one node only **generate once**, we add the stop node to `seen` when we generate it. Take a stop from queue and find all connected bus. The set `seen` record all visited stops and we won't check a stop for twice. We can also use a set to record all visited bus, or just clear a route after visit.

```python
class Solution:
    def numBusesToDestination(self, routes: List[List[int]], S: int, T: int) -> int:
        stop2bus = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for bus, route in enumerate(routes):
            for stop in route:
                stop2bus[stop].append(bus)
                
        q = collections.deque([(S, 0)])
        seen = set([S])
        while q:
            cur_stop, cnt = q.popleft()
            if cur_stop == T: return cnt
            for bus in stop2bus[cur_stop]:
                for nxt_stop in routes[bus]:
                    if nxt_stop not in seen:
                        q.append((nxt_stop, cnt + 1))
                        seen.add(nxt_stop)
                routes[bus] = []  # seen route
        return -1
```
