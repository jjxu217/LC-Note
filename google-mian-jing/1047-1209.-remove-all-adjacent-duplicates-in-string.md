## 1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String

Given a string `S` of lowercase letters, a _duplicate removal_ consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters, and removing them.

We repeatedly make duplicate removals on S until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.  It is guaranteed the answer is unique.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: "abbaca"
Output: "ca"
Explanation: 
For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.  The result of this move is that the string is "aaca", of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".
```

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, S: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        for char in S:
            if stack and char == stack[-1]:
                stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(char)
        return ''.join(stack)
```

## 1209. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String II

Given a string `s`, a _k_ _duplicate removal_ consists of choosing `k` adjacent and equal letters from `s` and removing them causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.

We repeatedly make `k` duplicate removals on `s` until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.

It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
Output: "aa"
Explanation: 
First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
Output: "ps"
```

### Use stack, record \[char, repeat\_time\]

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        if not s: return ''
        stack = []
        for char in s:
            if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:
                stack[-1][1] += 1
                if stack[-1][1] == k:
                    stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append([char, 1])
        return ''.join(c * k for c, k in stack)
```

## 比较简单的word extension， 找出一个string 里面重复超过3次的位置 比如‘heeeelllo’ should return \[\[1, 4\], \[5, 7\]\]

```python
def remove3repeat(nums):
    if len(nums) < 3: return []
    n = len(nums)
    fast = 0
    res = []
    while fast < n:
        begin = fast
        while fast < n and nums[fast] == nums[begin]:
            fast += 1
        if fast - begin >= 3:
            res.append([begin, fast])
    return res
    
```
