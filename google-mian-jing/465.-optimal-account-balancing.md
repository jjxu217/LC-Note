# 465. Optimal Account Balancing

A group of friends went on holiday and sometimes lent each other money. For example, Alice paid for Bill's lunch for $10. Then later Chris gave Alice $5 for a taxi ride. We can model each transaction as a tuple \(x, y, z\) which means person x gave person y $z. Assuming Alice, Bill, and Chris are person 0, 1, and 2 respectively \(0, 1, 2 are the person's ID\), the transactions can be represented as `[[0, 1, 10], [2, 0, 5]]`.

Given a list of transactions between a group of people, return the minimum number of transactions required to settle the debt.

**Note:**

1. A transaction will be given as a tuple \(x, y, z\). Note that `x ≠ y` and `z > 0`.
2. Person's IDs may not be linear, e.g. we could have the persons 0, 1, 2 or we could also have the persons 0, 2, 6.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:
[[0,1,10], [2,0,5]]

Output:
2

Explanation:
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.

Two transactions are needed. One way to settle the debt is person #1 pays person #0 and #2 $5 each.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input:
[[0,1,10], [1,0,1], [1,2,5], [2,0,5]]

Output:
1

Explanation:
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #1 gave person #0 $1.
Person #1 gave person #2 $5.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.

Therefore, person #1 only need to give person #0 $4, and all debt is settled.
```

### Back-tracking: 

**最多n层，每层最多n-1个叉。  
第idx层表示 clear第idx个人的debt；每层有i in range\(idx + 1, n\)个叉，表示第i个人来clear idx的debt**

With all the given transactions, in the end, each person with ID = `id` will have an overall balance `bal[id]`. Note that the `id` value or any person coincidentally with `0` balance is irrelevant to debt settling count, where

* `debt[i] > 0` means a person needs to pay `$ debt[i]` to other person\(s\);
* `debt[i] < 0` means a person needs to collect `$ debt[i]` back from other person\(s\).

Starting from first debt `debt[0]`, we look for all other debts `debt[i]` \(`i>0`\) which have opposite sign to `debt[0]`. Then each such `debt[i]` can make one transaction `debt[i] += debt[0]` to clear the person with debt `debt[0]`. From now on, the person with debt `debt[0]` is dropped out of the problem and we recursively drop persons one by one until everyone's debt is cleared meanwhile updating the minimum number of transactions during DFS.

```python
def minTransfers(self, transactions: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        #build the balance sheet, get debt
        bal = collections.defaultdict(int)    
        for x, y, z in transactions:
            bal[x] -= z
            bal[y] += z    
        debt = list(bal.values())
        n = len(debt)
        
        #idx is the index of current person, left of idx is debt-cleared.
        def dfs(idx):
            #if debt[idx] 已经clear 考虑下一个
            while idx < n and debt[idx] == 0:
                idx += 1
            if idx == n: return 0
            
            #clear idx debt with the person on the right of idx
            r = float('inf')
            for i in range(idx + 1, n):
                if debt[i] * debt[idx] < 0:
                    # idx debt cleared with i
                    debt[i] += debt[idx]
                    r = min(r, 1 + dfs(idx+1))
                    # backtrack
                    debt[i] -= debt[idx]
            return r
        
        return dfs(0)
```

### BFS:

transactions = \[ \[6, 0, 50\], \[1, 6, 40\], \[2, 6, 10\], \[6, 3, 40\], \[6, 4, 10\], \[5, 6, 25\] \]

**First, exclude those people have 0 balance.**  
Then we will have an array of non-zero numbers, which sums to be zero. For example

\[4, -2, -2, 6, -6\] -&gt;\[4,-2,-2\] and \[6,-6\]

**This can be converted into finding the minimal sub-group such that the elements sum up to be zero**. **`res = len(debt) - number of sub-group sum to 0`**

* Initialize**`res = len(debt):`**Using `len(debt) - 1` transactions, we can always settle the debts \(image we give all money to one man, and then this man distributes all his money to all debtors\)
* **`res -= 1`** when we find a sub-group sum to 0. we know `len(debt) - 1` is the upper bound, if we can split `debt` into 2 groups with each `sum = 0`, then the upper bound becomes `len(debt) - 2`

**Start with one element in the set as the root, find the minimal length path in the tree which sum up to be zero. Remove that zero sum set and pick another root.**

```python
    def minTransfers(self, transactions):
        def remove_one_zero_clique(non_zero):
            n = len(non_zero)
            q = collections.deque()            
            # q store ([index set], sum of set)
            q.append(([0], non_zero[0]))
            min_zero_set = None

            while q:
                cur_set, cur_sum = q.popleft()
                if cur_sum == 0:
                    min_zero_set = cur_set
                    break
                for j in range(cur_set[-1] + 1, n):
                    q.append((cur_set + [j], cur_sum + non_zero[j]))
            
            min_zero_set = set(min_zero_set)
            return [non_zero[i] for i in range(n) if i not in min_zero_set]
        
        
        bal = collections.defaultdict(int)
        for t in transactions:
            bal[t[0]] -= t[2]
            bal[t[1]] += t[2]
        non_zero = [bal[k] for k in bal if bal[k] != 0]
        
        res = len(non_zero)
        while len(non_zero) > 0:
            non_zero = remove_one_zero_clique(non_zero)
            res -= 1
        return res
```
