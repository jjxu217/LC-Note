# 708. Insert into a Cyclic Sorted List

Given a node from a cyclic linked list which is sorted in ascending order, write a function to insert a value into the list such that it remains a cyclic sorted list. The given node can be a reference to _any_ single node in the list, and may not be necessarily the smallest value in the cyclic list.

If there are multiple suitable places for insertion, you may choose any place to insert the new value. After the insertion, the cyclic list should remain sorted.

If the list is empty \(i.e., given node is `null`\), you should create a new single cyclic list and return the reference to that single node. Otherwise, you should return the original given node.

The following example may help you understand the problem better:

In the figure above, there is a cyclic sorted list of three elements. You are given a reference to the node with value 3, and we need to insert 2 into the list.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/19/example_1_after_65p.jpg)  
  
The new node should insert between node 1 and node 3. After the insertion, the list should look like this, and we should still return node 3.

```python
class Solution:
    #insert at the end; insert in the middle; insert before head 
    #(e.g. all the values are equal in the original list)
    def insert(self, head: 'Node', insertVal: int) -> 'Node':
        new_node = Node(insertVal, head)
        
        if not head:  
            return new_node
         
        node = head
        while True:
            if node.next.val < node.val and (insertVal <= node.next.val or insertVal >= node.val):
                break
            elif node.val <= insertVal <= node.next.val:
                break
            elif node.next == head:
                break
            node = node.next
        
        new_node.next = node.next
        node.next = new_node
        return head
```
