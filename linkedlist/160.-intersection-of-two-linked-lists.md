# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:[![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_statement.png)](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_statement.png)

begin to intersect at node c1.

**Example 1:**[![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_1.png)](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_1.png)

```text
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
```

**Example 2:**[![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_2.png)](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_2.png)

```text
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
```

**Example 3:**[![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_3.png)](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_3.png)

```text
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: null
Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
```

### Note: 注意指针换的条件

the condition is: pa = pa.next **if pa** else headB

```python
class Solution(object):
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA, headB):
        if not headA or not headB:
            return None
        pa, pb = headA, headB # 2 pointers
        while pa != pb:
            # if either pointer hits the end, switch head and continue the second traversal, 
            # if not hit the end, just move on to next
            pa = pa.next if pa else headB
            pb = pb.next if pb else headA

        return pa # only 2 ways to get out of the loop, they meet or the both hit the end=None
```
