# 86. Partition List

Given a linked list and a value _x_, partition it such that all nodes less than _x_ come before nodes greater than or equal to _x_.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

**Example:**

```text
Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3
Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5
```

### Solution

define **large\_head, large\_tail, small\_head, small\_tail,** traverse LinkedList then connect small list with large one.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def partition(self, head, x):
        lh = lt = ListNode(0)
        sh = st = ListNode(0)
        while head:
            if head.val >= x:
                lt.next = head
                lt = lt.next
            else:
                st.next = head
                st = st.next
            head = head.next
        st.next, lt.next = lh.next, None
        return sh.next
```
