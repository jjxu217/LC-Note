# 149. Max Points on a Line

Given _n_ points on a 2D plane, find the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 3

### sol: 以点为中心：对每个点，算其他点对应的斜率，用counter记录, time=O\(n^2\)

```python
from decimal import *
class Solution:
    #以点为中心：对每个点，算其他点对应的斜率，用counter记录
    def maxPoints(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not points or len(points) <= 2: return len(points)
        n = len(points)
        res = 0
        points.sort()
        for i in range(n):
            c = collections.Counter()
            overlap, curmax = 0, 0
            for j in range(i):
                dx, dy = points[i][0]- points[j][0], points[i][1] - points[j][1]
                if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
                    overlap += 1
                    continue
                slope = Decimal(dy) / dx if dx != 0 else 'infinity' #Decimal deal with float point
                c[slope] += 1
                curmax = max(curmax, c[slope])
            res = max(res, curmax+overlap+1)
        return res

### Q4 Most number of points in 2D space problem

#### Q4.1 Given an array of coordinates of points, how to find largest number of points that can be crossed by a same line in 2D space.

Sol: Time=O\(n^2\)  
y = a \* x + b: slope-intersect form  
Use HashMap {\(a,b\): Set\(point\)}  
for Pi{for Pj {Calculate y = a \* x + b; HashMap\[Line{a,b}\].add\(Points\)}}  
**Corner case:** when a = infinity, which means that the line is perpendicular to the x-axis

#### Q4.2 Given an array of coordinates of points, how to find largest number of points that can form a set such that any pair of points in the set can form a line with positive slope.
