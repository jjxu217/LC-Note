# 792. Number of Matching Subsequences

Given string `S` and a dictionary of words `words`, find the number of `words[i]` that is a subsequence of `S`.

```text
Example :
Input: 
S = "abcde"
words = ["a", "bb", "acd", "ace"]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three words in words that are a subsequence of S: "a", "acd", "ace".
```

### Sol1: Using iterators to represent words and their progress:

**Runtime** is linear in the total size of the input \(`S` and all of `words`\).

```python
    def numMatchingSubseq(self, S, words):
        waiting = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for it in map(iter, words):
            waiting[next(it)].append(it)
        for c in S:
            for it in waiting.pop(c, ()):
                waiting[next(it, None)].append(it)
        return len(waiting[None])
```

#### Explanation:

I go through S once, and while I'm doing that, I move through all words accordingly. That is, I keep track of how much of each word I've already seen, and with each letter of S, I advance the words waiting for that letter. To quickly find the words waiting for a certain letter, I store each word \(and its progress\) in a list of words waiting for that letter. Then for each of the lucky words whose current letter just occurred in S, I update their progress and store them in the list for their next letter.

Let's go through the given example:

```text
S = "abcde"
words = ["a", "bb", "acd", "ace"]
```

I store that `"a"`, `"acd"` and `"ace"` are waiting for an `'a'` and `"bb"` is waiting for a `'b'` \(using parentheses to show how far I am in each word\):

```text
'a':  ["(a)", "(a)cd", "(a)ce"]
'b':  ["(b)b"]
```

Then I go through S. First I see `'a'`, so I take the list of words waiting for `'a'` and store them as waiting under their next letter:

```text
'b':  ["(b)b"]
'c':  ["a(c)d", "a(c)e"]
None: ["a"]
```

You see `"a"` is already waiting for nothing anymore, while `"acd"` and `"ace"` are now waiting for `'c'`. Next I see `'b'` and update accordingly:

```text
'b':  ["b(b)"]
'c':  ["a(c)d", "a(c)e"]
None: ["a"]
```

Then `'c'`:

```text
'b':  ["b(b)"]
'd':  ["ac(d)"]
'e':  ["ac(e)"]
None: ["a"]
```

Then `'d'`:

```text
'b':  ["b(b)"]
'e':  ["ac(e)"]
None: ["a", "acd"]
```

Then `'e'`:

```text
'b':  ["b(b)"]
None: ["a", "acd", "ace"]
```

And now I just return how many words aren't waiting for anything anymore.

### Sol2:

The idea is to use the String S and build a dictionary of indexes for each character in the string.  
Then for each word, we can go character by character and see if it is a subsequence, by using the corresponding index dictionary, but just making sure that the index of the current character occurs after the index where the previous character was seen. To speed up the processing, we should use binary search in the index dictionary.

As an example for S = "aacbacbde"  
the  
`dict_idxs =  
{a: [0, 1, 4],  
b: [3, 6],  
c: [2, 5],  
d: [7],  
e: [8]}`  
Now for the word say "abcb", starting with d\_i = 0,  
a =&gt; get list for a in the dict\_idxs which is \[0, 1, 4\], and in the list, find the index of a &gt;= d\_i which is 0. After this update d\_i to +1 =&gt; 1  
b =&gt; get list for b in the dict\_idxs \[3, 6\], and in the list, find the index of b &gt;= d\_i =&gt; &gt;= 1, which is at index 0 =&gt; 3, after this update d\_i to 4+1 =&gt; 4  
c =&gt; in the list for c, \[3, 5\], find the index of c &gt;= 4, which is 5. update d\_i to 5+1 = 6  
b =&gt; in the list for b, \[3, 6\], fund the index of b &gt;= 6, which is 6, update d\_i to 7, since this is the end of the word, and we have found all characters in the word in the index dictionary, we return True for this word.

```python
    def numMatchingSubseq(self, S, words):
        def isMatch(word, w_i, d_i):
            if w_i == len(word): return True
            l = dict_idxs[word[w_i]]
            if len(l) == 0 or d_i > l[-1]: return False
            i = l[bisect_left(l, d_i)]
            return isMatch(word, w_i + 1, i + 1)

        dict_idxs = defaultdict(list)
        for i in range(len(S)):
            dict_idxs[S[i]].append(i)
        return sum(isMatch(word, 0, 0) for word in words)
```
