# 792. Number of Matching Subsequences 1055. Shortest Way to Form String

Given string `S` and a dictionary of words `words`, find the number of `words[i]` that is a subsequence of `S`.

```text
Example :
Input: 
S = "abcde"
words = ["a", "bb", "acd", "ace"]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three words in words that are a subsequence of S: "a", "acd", "ace".
```

### Sol1: Using iterators to represent words and their progress:

**Runtime** is linear in the total size of the input \(`S` and all of `words`\).

```python
    def numMatchingSubseq(self, S, words):
        waiting = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for it in map(iter, words):
            waiting[next(it)].append(it)
        for c in S:
            for it in waiting.pop(c, ()):
                waiting[next(it, None)].append(it)
        return len(waiting[None])
```

#### Explanation:

I go through S once, and while I'm doing that, I move through all words accordingly. That is, I keep track of how much of each word I've already seen, and with each letter of S, I advance the words waiting for that letter. To quickly find the words waiting for a certain letter, I store each word \(and its progress\) in a list of words waiting for that letter. Then for each of the lucky words whose current letter just occurred in S, I update their progress and store them in the list for their next letter.

Let's go through the given example:

```text
S = "abcde"
words = ["a", "bb", "acd", "ace"]
```

I store that `"a"`, `"acd"` and `"ace"` are waiting for an `'a'` and `"bb"` is waiting for a `'b'` \(using parentheses to show how far I am in each word\):

```text
'a':  ["(a)", "(a)cd", "(a)ce"]
'b':  ["(b)b"]
```

Then I go through S. First I see `'a'`, so I take the list of words waiting for `'a'` and store them as waiting under their next letter:

```text
'b':  ["(b)b"]
'c':  ["a(c)d", "a(c)e"]
None: ["a"]
```

You see `"a"` is already waiting for nothing anymore, while `"acd"` and `"ace"` are now waiting for `'c'`. Next I see `'b'` and update accordingly:

```text
'b':  ["b(b)"]
'c':  ["a(c)d", "a(c)e"]
None: ["a"]
```

Then `'c'`:

```text
'b':  ["b(b)"]
'd':  ["ac(d)"]
'e':  ["ac(e)"]
None: ["a"]
```

Then `'d'`:

```text
'b':  ["b(b)"]
'e':  ["ac(e)"]
None: ["a", "acd"]
```

Then `'e'`:

```text
'b':  ["b(b)"]
None: ["a", "acd", "ace"]
```

And now I just return how many words aren't waiting for anything anymore.

### Sol2:

The idea is to use the String S and build a dictionary of indexes for each character in the string.  
Then for each word, we can go character by character and see if it is a subsequence, by using the corresponding index dictionary, but just making sure that the index of the current character occurs after the index where the previous character was seen. To speed up the processing, we should use binary search in the index dictionary.

As an example for S = "aacbacbde"  
the  
`dict_idxs =  
{a: [0, 1, 4],  
b: [3, 6],  
c: [2, 5],  
d: [7],  
e: [8]}`  
Now for the word say "abcb", starting with d\_i = 0,  
a =&gt; get list for a in the dict\_idxs which is \[0, 1, 4\], and in the list, find the index of a &gt;= d\_i which is 0. After this update d\_i to +1 =&gt; 1  
b =&gt; get list for b in the dict\_idxs \[3, 6\], and in the list, find the index of b &gt;= d\_i =&gt; &gt;= 1, which is at index 0 =&gt; 3, after this update d\_i to 4+1 =&gt; 4  
c =&gt; in the list for c, \[3, 5\], find the index of c &gt;= 4, which is 5. update d\_i to 5+1 = 6  
b =&gt; in the list for b, \[3, 6\], fund the index of b &gt;= 6, which is 6, update d\_i to 7, since this is the end of the word, and we have found all characters in the word in the index dictionary, we return True for this word.

```python
    def numMatchingSubseq(self, S, words):
        def isMatch(word, w_i, d_i):
            if w_i == len(word): return True
            l = dict_idxs[word[w_i]]
            if len(l) == 0 or d_i > l[-1]: return False
            i = l[bisect_left(l, d_i)]
            return isMatch(word, w_i + 1, i + 1)

        dict_idxs = defaultdict(list)
        for i in range(len(S)):
            dict_idxs[S[i]].append(i)
        return sum(isMatch(word, 0, 0) for word in words)
```

## 1055. Shortest Way to Form String

From any string, we can form a subsequence of that string by deleting some number of characters \(possibly no deletions\).

Given two strings `source` and `target`, return the minimum number of subsequences of `source` such that their concatenation equals `target`. If the task is impossible, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: source = "abc", target = "abcbc"
Output: 2
Explanation: The target "abcbc" can be formed by "abc" and "bc", which are subsequences of source "abc".
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: source = "abc", target = "acdbc"
Output: -1
Explanation: The target string cannot be constructed from the subsequences of source string due to the character "d" in target string.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: source = "xyz", target = "xzyxz"
Output: 3
Explanation: The target string can be constructed as follows "xz" + "y" + "xz".
```

### Idea

This is a google phone screen question. It's the same idea as [792. Number of Matching Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-matching-subsequences/description/). I recommend solving that question first.

The idea is to create an [inverted index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) that saves the offsets of where each character occurs in `source`. The index data structure is represented as a hashmap, where the Key is the character, and the Value is the \(sorted\) list of offsets where this character appears. To run the algorithm, for each character in `target`, use the index to get the list of possible offsets for this character. Then search this list for next offset which appears after the offset of the previous character. We can use binary search to efficiently search for the next offset in our index.

Example with `source` = "abcab", `target` = "aabbaac"  
The inverted index data structure for this example would be:  
inverted\_index = {  
a: \[0, 3\] \# 'a' appears at index 0, 3 in source  
b: \[1, 4\], \# 'b' appears at index 1, 4 in source  
c: \[2\], \# 'c' appears at index 2 in source  
}  
Initialize `i` = -1 \(i represents the smallest valid next offset\) and `loop_cnt` = 1 \(number of passes through source\).  
Iterate through the target string "aabbaac"  
a =&gt; get the offsets of character 'a' which is \[0, 3\]. Set `i` to 1.  
a =&gt; get the offsets of character 'a' which is \[0, 3\]. Set `i` to 4.  
b =&gt; get the offsets of character 'b' which is \[1, 4\]. Set `i` to 5.  
b =&gt; get the offsets of character 'b' which is \[1, 4\]. Increment `loop_cnt` to 2, and Set `i` to 2.  
a =&gt; get the offsets of character 'a' which is \[0, 3\]. Set `i` to 4.  
a =&gt; get the offsets of character 'a' which is \[0, 3\]. Increment `loop_cnt` to 3, and Set `i` to 1.  
c =&gt; get the offsets of character 'c' which is \[2\]. Set `i` to 3.  
We're done iterating through target so return the number of loops \(3\).

The runtime is O\(M\) to build the index, and O\(logM\) for each query. There are N queries, so the total runtime is O\(M + N\*logM\). M is the length of source and N is the length of target. The space complexity is O\(M\), which is the space needed to store the index.

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestWay(self, source: str, target: str) -> int:
        dict_idxs = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for i, ch in enumerate(source):
            dict_idxs[ch].append(i)

        cnt = 1
        i = -1
        for ch in target:
            if ch not in dict_idxs:
                return -1
            l = dict_idxs[ch]
            # bisect_left(A, x) returns the smallest index j s.t. A[j] >= x. If no such index j exists, it returns len(A).
            j = bisect.bisect_left(l, i)
            if j == len(l):
                cnt += 1
                i = l[0] + 1
            else:
                i = l[j] + 1
        return cnt
    
#dp solution    
    def shortestWay(self, source: str, target: str) -> int:
        if len(set(target) - set(source)) > 0: return -1
        
        m = len(source)
        move = [[-1] * 26 for _ in range(m)]        
        move[0] = [source.find(chr(c)) + 1 for c in range(97, 97+26)]    
        
        for i in range(-1, -m, -1):
            move[i] = list(map(lambda x: x+1, move[i+1]))
            move[i][ord(source[i]) - 97] = 1
        
        i = 0
        for c in target: 
            i += move[i % m][ord(c) - 97]

        return i // m + (i % m > 0)
```
