# 659. Split Array into Consecutive Subsequences

Given an array `nums` sorted in ascending order, return `true` if and only if you can split it into 1 or more subsequences such that each subsequence consists of consecutive integers and has length at least 3.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3
3, 4, 5

```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
3, 4, 5

```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: [1,2,3,4,4,5]
Output: False
```

### Idea: greedy

`left`is a hashmap, `left[i]` counts the number of `i` that I haven't placed yet.  
`end`is a hashmap, `end[i]` counts the number of consecutive subsequences that ends at number `i`  
Then I tried to split the nums one by one.  
If I could neither add a number to the end of a existing consecutive subsequence nor find two following number in the left, I returned `False`

```python
    def isPossible(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        left = collections.Counter(nums)
        end = collections.Counter()
        for i in nums:
            if not left[i]: continue
            left[i] -= 1
            if end[i - 1] > 0:
                end[i - 1] -= 1
                end[i] += 1
            elif left[i + 1] and left[i + 2]:
                left[i + 1] -= 1
                left[i + 2] -= 1
                end[i + 2] += 1
            else:
                return False
        return True
```
