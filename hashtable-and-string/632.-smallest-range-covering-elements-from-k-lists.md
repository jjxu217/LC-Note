# 632. Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists

You have `k` lists of sorted integers in ascending order. Find the **smallest** range that includes at least one number from each of the `k` lists.

We define the range \[a,b\] is smaller than range \[c,d\] if `b-a < d-c` or `a < c` if `b-a == d-c`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [[4,10,15,24,26], [0,9,12,20], [5,18,22,30]]
Output: [20,24]
Explanation: 
List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24,26], 24 is in range [20,24].
List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20], 20 is in range [20,24].
List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30], 22 is in range [20,24].
```

### Idea: maintain a min heap to record\(ele, row-idx, col-idx\), always has k ele; for current iteration, left is the min of heap, right is the max of the ele in heap, update res is needed. When all elements in one row are checked, return

 k: row number; n: all elements, **time=O\(nlog\(k\)\)**  
We want to increase the minimum and decrease the maximum. The maximum value can't be reduced any further, since it already corresponds to the minimum value in one of the lists. Reducing it any further will lead to the exclusion of all the elements of this list\(containing the last maximum value\) from the new range. Thus, the only option left in our hand is to try to **increase the minimum value**. 

```python
    def smallestRange(self, nums: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        h = [(row[0], r, 0) for r, row in enumerate(nums)]
        heapq.heapify(h)        
        ans = []
        
        right = max(row[0] for row in nums) #initialize right       
        while h:
            left, r, c = heapq.heappop(h)
            if right - left < ans[1] - ans[0]: #update ans
                ans = [left, right]
                
            #if all ele in one row is checked, return res
            if c == len(nums[r]) - 1: 
                return ans
            
            #check the next element in cur row, push to heap and update right
            nxt = nums[r][c + 1]
            heapq.heappush(h, (nxt, r, c + 1))
            right = max(right, nxt)       
```
