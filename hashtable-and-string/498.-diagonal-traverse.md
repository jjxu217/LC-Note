# 498. Diagonal Traverse

Given a matrix of M x N elements \(M rows, N columns\), return all elements of the matrix in diagonal order as shown in the below image.

**Example:**

```text
Input:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]

Output:  [1,2,4,7,5,3,6,8,9]

### Sol: two step: use dict to Group numbers according to diagonals

**1- Group numbers according to diagonals. Sum of row+col in same diagonal is same.   
2- Reverse numbers in odd diagonals before adding numbers to result list.**

In python 3.6+, dict is ordered by the add sequence

```python
class Solution:
    def findDiagonalOrder(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        if not matrix or not matrix[0]: return []
        res = []
        lines = collections.defaultdict(list)
        # Step 1: Numbers are grouped by the diagonals.
        # Numbers in same diagonal have same value of row+col
        for i in range(len(matrix)):
            for j in range(len(matrix[0])):
                lines[i+j].append(matrix[i][j])
        # Step 2: Place diagonals in the result list, reverse numbers in odd diagonals.
        for k in range(len(matrix) + len(matrix[0]) - 1): #python3.6-: for k in sorted(lines.keys()):
            if k % 2 == 0:
                res += lines[k][::-1]
            else:
                res += lines[k]
        return res
```
