# 498. Diagonal Traverse

Given a matrix of M x N elements \(M rows, N columns\), return all elements of the matrix in diagonal order as shown in the below image.

**Example:**

```text
Input:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]

Output:  [1,2,4,7,5,3,6,8,9]

### Sol: two step: use dict to Group numbers according to diagonals

**1- Group numbers according to diagonals. Sum of row+col in same diagonal is same.   
2- Reverse numbers in odd diagonals before adding numbers to result list.**

In python 3.6+, dict is ordered by the add sequence

```python
class Solution:
    def findDiagonalOrder(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        if not matrix or not matrix[0]: return []
        res = []
        lines = collections.defaultdict(list)
        # Step 1: Numbers are grouped by the diagonals.
        # Numbers in same diagonal have same value of row+col
        for i in range(len(matrix)):
            for j in range(len(matrix[0])):
                lines[i+j].append(matrix[i][j])
        # Step 2: Place diagonals in the result list, reverse numbers in odd diagonals.
        for k in range(len(matrix) + len(matrix[0]) - 1): #python3.6-: for k in sorted(lines.keys()):
            if k % 2 == 0:
                res += lines[k][::-1]
            else:
                res += lines[k]
        return res
```

## Zigzag \(or diagonal\) traversal of Matrix

Given a 2D matrix, print all elements of the given matrix in diagonal order. For example, consider the following 5 X 4 input matrix.

```text
    1     2     3     4
    5     6     7     8
    9    10    11    12
   13    14    15    16
   17    18    19    20
```

Diagonal printing of the above matrix is

```text
    1
    5     2
    9     6     3
   13    10     7     4
   17    14    11     8
   18    15    12
   19    16
   20
```

Another example:  
![diagonal-matrix](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/zigzag-1.png)

```python
# Python3 program to print all elements 
# of given matrix in diagonal order 
ROW = 5
COL = 4

# Main function that prints given 
# matrix in diagonal order 
def diagonalOrder(matrix) : 
	, n  = 
	# There will be ROW+COL-1 lines in the output 
	for line in range(1, (ROW + COL)) : 
		# Get column index of the first element 
		# in this line of output. The index is 0 
		# for first ROW lines and line - ROW for 
		# remaining lines 
		start_col = max(0, line - ROW) 

		# Get count of elements in this line. 
		# The count of elements is equal to 
		# minimum of line number, COL-start_col and ROW 
		count = min(line, (COL - start_col), ROW) 

		# Print elements of this line 
		for j in range(0, count) : 
			print(matrix[min(ROW, line) - j - 1][start_col + j], end = "\t") 
		print() 
```
