# Reverse String 344/541/151/186/557/345

## 344. Reverse String

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `char[]`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with O\(1\) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of [printable ascii characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        l, r = 0, len(s) - 1
        while l < r:
            s[l], s[r] = s[r], s[l]
            l += 1
            r -= 1
```

## 541. Reverse String II

Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string. If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.

**Example:**  


```text
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
```

**Restrictions:**

1. The string consists of lower English letters only.
2. Length of the given string and k will in the range \[1, 10000\]

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseStr(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        s = list(s)
        for i in range(0, len(s), 2*k):
            s[i:i+k] = reversed(s[i:i+k])
        return ''.join(s)
```

## 151. Reverse Words in a String

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: "  hello world!  "
Output: "world! hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        s = s.split()
        return ' '.join(s[::-1])
    
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        # First reverse entire string, then iterate over reversed string
        # and again reverse order of characters within a word. Append each word to words.
        word = ""
        words = ""
        s = s[::-1]
        for j, i in enumerate(s):
            # character is not space, a current word exists, 
            # and previous character is space, e.g. i=b in " a b":
            if i != " " and word != "" and s[j-1] == " ":
                # add current word to words and append " " to later add this i
                words += (word + " ")
                word = i
            # character is not space, but it's either first character in string
            # or is part of current word, e.g. i=b in "b", " b" "ab", "a ab "
            elif i != " ":
                word = i + word
            
        words += word
        return(words)
```

## 186. Reverse Words in a String II

Given an input string _****_, reverse the string word by word. 

**Example:**

```text
Input:  ["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"]
Output: ["b","l","u","e"," ","i","s"," ","s","k","y"," ","t","h","e"]
```

**Note:** 

* A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
* The input string does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
* The words are always separated by a single space.

**Follow up:** Could you do it **in-place** without allocating extra space?

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        self.reverse(s, 0, len(s) - 1)
        l = r = 0
        for i, ele in enumerate(s):
            if ele == ' ':
                self.reverse(s, l, i - 1)
                l = i + 1
            elif i == len(s) - 1:
                self.reverse(s, l, i)       
        
    def reverse(self, s, l, r):
        while l < r:
            s[l], s[r] = s[r], s[l]
            l += 1
            r -= 1
```

## 557. Reverse Words in a String III

Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

**Example 1:**  


```text
Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
```

**Note:** In the string, each word is separated by single space and there will not be any extra space in the string.

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        return ' '.join(s.split()[::-1])[::-1]
```

## 345. Reverse Vowels of a String

Write a function that takes a string as input and reverse only the vowels of a string.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: "hello"
Output: "holle"
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: "leetcode"
Output: "leotcede"
```

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseVowels(self, s: str) -> str:
        v = set(list("aeiouAEIOU"))
        l, r = 0, len(s) - 1
        s = list(s)
        while l < r:
            if s[l] in v and s[r] in v:
                s[l], s[r] = s[r], s[l]
                l += 1
                r -= 1
            elif s[l] not in v:
                l += 1
            elif s[r] not in v:
                r -= 1
        return ''.join(s)
```
