# 1153. String Transforms Into Another String

Encode

Given two strings `str1` and `str2` of the same length, determine whether you can transform `str1` into `str2` by doing **zero or more** _conversions_.

In one conversion you can convert **all** occurrences of one character in `str1` to **any** other lowercase English character.

Return `true` if and only if you can transform `str1` into `str2`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: str1 = "aabcc", str2 = "ccdee"
Output: true
Explanation: Convert 'c' to 'e' then 'b' to 'd' then 'a' to 'c'. Note that the order of conversions matter.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: str1 = "leetcode", str2 = "codeleet"
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to transform str1 to str2.
```

### **Explanation**

Scan `s1` and `s2` at the same time,  
record the transform mapping into a map/array.  
The same char should transform to the same char.  
Otherwise we can directly return false.

To realize the transformation:

1. transformation of link link ,like `a -> b -> c`: we do the transformation from end to begin, that is `b->c` then `a->b`
2. transformation of cycle, like `a -> b -> c -> a`: in this case we need a `tmp` `c->tmp`, `b->c` `a->b` and `tmp->a` Same as the process of swap two variable.

In both case, there should at least one character that is unused,  
to use it as the `tmp` for transformation.  
So we need to return if the size of set of unused characters &lt; 26.

**Complexity**  
Time `O(N)` for scanning input  
Space `O(26)` to record the mapping  
running time can be improved if count available character during the scan.

```python
class Solution:
    #define a mapping from char1 to char2, there should at least 
    # one character that is unused in s2 otherwise there would be cycle
    def canConvert(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        if s1 == s2: return True
        dp = {}
        for i, j in zip(s1, s2):
            if dp.setdefault(i, j) != j:
                return False
        return len(set(s2)) < 26
```
