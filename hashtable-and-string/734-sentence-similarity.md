# 734/737 Sentence Similarity

## 734. Sentence Similarity

Given two sentences `words1, words2` \(each represented as an array of strings\), and a list of similar word pairs `pairs`, determine if two sentences are similar.

For example, "great acting skills" and "fine drama talent" are similar, if the similar word pairs are `pairs = [["great", "fine"], ["acting","drama"], ["skills","talent"]]`.

Note that the similarity relation is not transitive. For example, if "great" and "fine" are similar, and "fine" and "good" are similar, "great" and "good" are **not** necessarily similar.

However, similarity is symmetric. For example, "great" and "fine" being similar is the same as "fine" and "great" being similar.

Also, a word is always similar with itself. For example, the sentences `words1 = ["great"], words2 = ["great"], pairs = []` are similar, even though there are no specified similar word pairs.

Finally, sentences can only be similar if they have the same number of words. So a sentence like `words1 = ["great"]` can never be similar to `words2 = ["doubleplus","good"]`.

```python
class Solution:
    def areSentencesSimilar(self, words1: List[str], words2: List[str], pairs: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        if len(words1) != len(words2): return False

        pairset = set(map(tuple, pairs))
        return all(w1 == w2 or (w1, w2) in pairset or (w2, w1) in pairset
                   for w1, w2 in zip(words1, words2))
```

## 737. Sentence Similarity II

Given two sentences `words1, words2` \(each represented as an array of strings\), and a list of similar word pairs `pairs`, determine if two sentences are similar.

For example, `words1 = ["great", "acting", "skills"]` and `words2 = ["fine", "drama", "talent"]` are similar, if the similar word pairs are `pairs = [["great", "good"], ["fine", "good"], ["acting","drama"], ["skills","talent"]]`.

Note that the similarity relation **is** transitive. For example, if "great" and "good" are similar, and "fine" and "good" are similar, then "great" and "fine" **are similar**.

Similarity is also symmetric. For example, "great" and "fine" being similar is the same as "fine" and "great" being similar.

Also, a word is always similar with itself. For example, the sentences `words1 = ["great"], words2 = ["great"], pairs = []` are similar, even though there are no specified similar word pairs.

Finally, sentences can only be similar if they have the same number of words. So a sentence like `words1 = ["great"]` can never be similar to `words2 = ["doubleplus","good"]`.

### Union Find

```python
class DSU:
    def __init__(self):
        self.p = list(range(1001))
    
    def find(self, x):
        if self.p[x] != x:
            self.p[x] = self.find(self.p[x])
        return self.p[x]
        
    def union(self, x, y):
        xr, yr = self.find(x), self.find(y)
        if xr == yr:
            return False
        self.p[xr] = yr
        return True
    

    
class Solution:
    def areSentencesSimilarTwo(self, words1: List[str], words2: List[str], pairs: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        if len(words1) != len(words2):
            return False
        
        idx = 0
        word2id = {}
        dsu = DSU()
        for a, b in pairs:
            if a not in word2id:
                word2id[a] = idx
                idx += 1
            if b not in word2id:
                word2id[b] = idx
                idx += 1
            dsu.union(word2id[a], word2id[b])
         
        return all(a == b or (a in word2id and b in word2id and \
        dsu.find(word2id[a]) == dsu.find(word2id[b])) for a, b in zip(words1, words2))
```
