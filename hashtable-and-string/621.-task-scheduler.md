# 621. Task Scheduler

Given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital letters A to Z where different letters represent different tasks. Tasks could be done without original order. Each task could be done in one interval. For each interval, CPU could finish one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative cooling interval **n** that means between two **same tasks**, there must be at least n intervals that CPU are doing different tasks or just be idle.

You need to return the **least** number of intervals the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

**Example:**

```text
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
```

### Sol: use heap to record the amount of different tasks

```python
class Solution:
    # O(nlogn) greedy to place most popular and distinct tasks first
    # We always place different tasks in a cycle which will minimize steps
    # If not different tasks can be placed in a cycle, place an `idle`.  
    def _leastInterval(self, tasks, n):
        n += 1
        ans = 0
        d = collections.Counter(tasks)
        heap = [-c for c in d.values()]
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        while heap:
            cnt, stack = 0, []
            for _ in range(n):
                if heap:
                    c = heapq.heappop(heap)
                    cnt += 1
                    if c < -1:
                        stack.append(c + 1)
            for item in stack:
                heapq.heappush(heap, item)
            ans += n if heap else cnt # last task or not
        return ans
    
    # O(n) # of the most frequent tasks, say longest, will determine the legnth
    # to void counting idle intervals, we count (longest - 1) * (n + 1)
    # then count how many will in the last cycle which means finding ties
    # if counted number is less than # of tasks which means 
    # less frequent tasks can be always placed in such cycle
    # and it won't cause any conflicts with requirement since even most frequent can be settle
    # finally, return max(# of task, total counted number)
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        task_counts = list(collections.Counter(tasks).values())
        M = max(task_counts)
        Mct = task_counts.count(M)
        return max(len(tasks), (M - 1) * (n + 1) + Mct)
```
